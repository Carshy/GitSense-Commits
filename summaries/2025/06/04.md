# Activity Summary for 6/4/2025

## 9:02:36 AM
The log shows multiple revisions of the `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/apis/art-jameel.api/src/controllers/payrollConfig.controller.js` file between 8:31 AM and 8:41 AM on June 4th, 2025.  The code remains largely unchanged across all revisions. The file contains various asynchronous controller functions for managing payroll configurations. These functions handle creating, retrieving (by ID and company ID), updating (completely and partially), and listing all payroll configurations.  Each function includes robust error handling and logging using `logger.info` and `logger.error` to record successful operations and encountered errors, respectively.  The logs are further persisted using a `loggerService`.  A notable aspect is that the `updatePayrollConfig` function has commented-out code related to detailed logging of updates using the `diff` function from `deep-object-diff` and activity logging via the `activityService`. This suggests that detailed logging was implemented initially but later removed or temporarily disabled.  The repeated use of `catchAsync` indicates a consistent approach to error handling in the controllers.  There are no apparent functional changes between the revisions. The only difference is the presence or absence of commented-out code in `updatePayrollConfig` function.
