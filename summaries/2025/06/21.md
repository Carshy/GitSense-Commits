# Activity Summary for 6/21/2025

## 3:38:16 AM
The log shows modifications to `c:\projects\storefront-coupon\src\app\page.tsx`.  The file underwent three changes between 2:53:12 AM and 2:53:48 AM on June 21, 2025.  The primary change involved adding a welcome message, "Welcome to Next JS Collins!!!", to an `<h1>` tag within a `div` element.  A secondary change removed the `import Image from "next/image";` statement, suggesting the removal of image functionality.  The styling of the `div` remained consistent across all revisions.


## 9:34:23 AM
The log shows modifications to `types.ts` and `axiosInstance.ts`.  The `types.ts` file underwent significant changes between 9:11:02 AM and 9:17:32 AM, primarily focusing on the `Product` interface. Initially, this interface was fully defined, then it was commented out and subsequently redefined in several steps, starting with a minimal version (only `id`, `title`, and `price`) and progressively adding more fields (`description`, `category`, `image`, `rating`) until it matched the original comprehensive definition.  This suggests an iterative process of refining or debugging the `Product` type. The final version at 9:17:32 AM is identical to the original at 9:11:02 AM, except for the comment which was removed at the end.

The `axiosInstance.ts` file was modified twice, with a minor change between 9:22:01 AM and 9:24:06 AM. This change involved replacing `AxiosRequestConfig` with `InternalAxiosRequestConfig` in the request interceptor's function signature, a likely internal refactoring that didn't alter the core functionality. The `axiosInstance` uses `fakestoreapi.com` as its base URL, incorporates a request interceptor for adding authentication tokens from `sessionStorage` (although a `TokenManager` is mentioned as future implementation), adds timestamps to GET requests to prevent caching, and includes a response interceptor for handling various HTTP error statuses, including specific error messages and the clearing of authentication tokens upon a 401 (Unauthorized) response.
