# Activity Summary for 6/9/2025

## 8:50:18 AM
On June 9th, 2025, at 7:22:05 AM, a comprehensive update was made to `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/personal/tell_a_tale_spot/tell_tales/users/models.py`.  This commit involved the creation and/or substantial modification of three Django models: `User`, `Profile`, and `Employee`, along with a `Department` model.

The `User` model extends Django's `AbstractUser`, adding a `role` field with choices for 'admin', 'moderator', and 'writer'.

The `Profile` model is a one-to-one extension of the `User` model, designed to store extensive personal information including biographical details, contact information (with phone number validation), emergency contact details, and timestamps for creation and update.  It includes calculated properties for `age` and `full_name`.

The `Department` model defines an organizational structure, with fields for name, description, head (a foreign key to the `User` model), and timestamps. It calculates the number of active employees and the head's full name.

The `Employee` model, also linked one-to-one with the `User` and `Profile` models, manages employee-specific data like employee ID, department, position, employment dates, status (active, inactive, etc.), employment type, compensation details, work location, and additional notes.  It includes calculated properties for active status, years of service, manager's name, and department name, and methods to retrieve direct and all subordinate reports.

All three models (`Profile`, `Department`, and `Employee`) utilize timestamps (`created_at` and `updated_at`) to track changes.  Extensive use of choices fields for defining options (e.g., role, marital status, gender, employment status, salary type) is a recurring pattern in the code.  The models demonstrate a clear hierarchical structure for managing users, their profiles, departmental affiliations, and employment details.
