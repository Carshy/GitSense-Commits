# Activity Summary for 6/2/2025

## 12:43:29 PM
The `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/personal/tell_media_admin/src/components/reusable/homeHeader.tsx` file was updated on 6/2/2025, 12:13:36 PM.  This React component `HomeHeader` renders a header with icons for Home, Settings, and Notifications, each displaying a tooltip on hover.  It also includes a profile picture (if available) that opens a dropdown menu with "My Profile" and "Logout" options.  The component uses Redux (`useAppSelector`, `useAppDispatch`) for authentication and profile information, and Next.js features like `Image` and `Link`.  The styling uses tailwindcss classes extensively for layout and visual elements.  The logout functionality dispatches a `logout` action.  The code shows a clear separation of concerns using functional components and hooks.
