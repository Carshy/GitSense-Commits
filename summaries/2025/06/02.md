# Activity Summary for 6/2/2025

## 12:43:29 PM
The `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/personal/tell_media_admin/src/components/reusable/homeHeader.tsx` file was updated on 6/2/2025, 12:13:36 PM.  This React component `HomeHeader` renders a header with icons for Home, Settings, and Notifications, each displaying a tooltip on hover.  It also includes a profile picture (if available) that opens a dropdown menu with "My Profile" and "Logout" options.  The component uses Redux (`useAppSelector`, `useAppDispatch`) for authentication and profile information, and Next.js features like `Image` and `Link`.  The styling uses tailwindcss classes extensively for layout and visual elements.  The logout functionality dispatches a `logout` action.  The code shows a clear separation of concerns using functional components and hooks.


## 1:43:34 PM
The log shows development on a user profile page (`/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/personal/tell_media_admin/src/app/users/profile/page.tsx`) and a reusable header component (`/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/personal/tell_media_admin/src/components/reusable/homeHeader.tsx`).

The `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/personal/tell_media_admin/src/components/reusable/homeHeader.tsx` file was updated once on June 2nd, 2025 at 1:05:24 PM.  This commit added a React component for a home header which includes links for Home, Settings, Notifications and a user profile dropdown containing profile and logout options.  It uses Redux for authentication and profile data.


The `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/personal/tell_media_admin/src/app/users/profile/page.tsx` file underwent multiple revisions on June 2nd, 2025.

* **1:07:12 PM:** An initial version of the `ProfilePage` component was created, containing minimal structure.
* **1:09:57 PM:**  The component was updated to include selectors from the Redux store to access user authentication and profile information.
* **1:28:03 PM:** A major update added extensive UI elements using `lucide-react` icons and styled the profile page with a sidebar and main content area.  It also introduced mock profile data, defaulting to "John Doe" if actual data is unavailable, to display user information such as contact details, personal information, emergency contact, and employment details.
* **1:30:24 PM:** A minor update to the layout adjusted the fixed sidebar height.
* **1:34:54 PM:** The `HomeHeader` component was integrated into the `ProfilePage`.
* **1:39:39 PM:** The `HomeHeader` component was temporarily removed (`{/* <HomeHeader /> */}`).
* **1:41:18 PM:** The final version of the code omits the `HomeHeader` component.


A recurring pattern in the `page.tsx` file is the consistent use of `useAppSelector` and `useAppDispatch` from `'@/hooks/reduxHooks'` to access and modify the Redux store.  The component consistently displays user profile data, fetching information from `state.auth` and `state.profile`.  The final versions of `page.tsx` creates a detailed user profile view using a sidebar and main content area, extensively leveraging the `lucide-react` library for icons.  The structure and style of the UI elements suggest a focus on responsiveness and a clear separation of profile sections.


## 2:47:46 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/personal/tell_media_admin/src/app/users/profile/page.tsx`, a React component rendering a user profile page.  The core functionality remains consistent throughout all revisions: displaying user profile information fetched (or mocked) from a Redux store.

The first significant change (1:47:16 PM) introduces a complete component with sections for profile summary, bio, personal information, emergency contact, and employment details.  This version uses a fixed left sidebar for the summary and a scrollable main content area.

A subsequent edit (1:47:24 PM) temporarily removes most of the main content area, leaving only the Emergency Contact and Employment Information sections.  This suggests a possible refactoring or debugging step.

The component is largely restored in the next update (1:48:16 PM), reverting to a similar structure as the initial version.

Minor changes occur at 2:01:56 PM, 2:02:33 PM, and likely involve small adjustments to the layout and styling.  Specifically, the height of the left sidebar (`h-screen` changed to `h-[95%]`) and the rounding of various elements (`rounded-lg` changed to `rounded-xl`) are modified.


The final version (2:08:58 PM) removes  `bg-gray-50` from the main `div`'s class,  slightly altering the overall background.  Throughout all revisions, the code uses Tailwind CSS for styling and `lucide-react` for icons. The data displayed is consistently fetched from a Redux store (`useAppSelector`) and employs default values if data is unavailable, indicating a robust approach to handling missing profile data.  The consistent use of default values ("John Doe", etc.) suggests the use of mock data for development.
