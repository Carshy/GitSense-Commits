# Activity Summary for 6/24/2025

## 6:22:58 AM
The log shows multiple updates to `EnhancedHeroSection.tsx` between 5:37 AM and 5:42 AM on June 24, 2025, primarily focusing on styling adjustments and a minor color change within the carousel's sparkle icon.  The component's structure and functionality remained consistent across these revisions. The changes involved minor tweaks to CSS classes, specifically in the `Sparkles` icon's color within the carousel (`text-orange-300` to `text-orange-500`), and there were no significant alterations to the code's logic.

Between 5:50 AM and 6:15 AM, `ProductDetails.tsx` received a single update.  This update was substantial, adding a fully functional product details component with features like quantity selection, add to cart functionality (with a placeholder for cart integration), wishlist addition, sharing capabilities (using the navigator.share API with fallback), and visually appealing UI elements using Tailwind CSS.

Finally, `ProductDetailPage.tsx` was updated twice, at 6:06 AM and 6:08 AM on June 24, 2025.  The changes were minor and appeared to be related to error handling. The core functionality, fetching product details and rendering the `ProductDetails` component based on loading and error states, remained unchanged.  The only visible difference between the two revisions is whitespace.
