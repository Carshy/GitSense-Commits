# Activity Summary for 6/25/2025

## 7:18:37 AM
The log shows a series of modifications to the `ProductCard.tsx` component within a storefront application.  There were no changes to `ProductDetails.tsx`. The `ProductCard.tsx` file underwent significant changes between 6:00:16 AM and 6:01:07 AM, adding authentication functionality.  Further minor refinements to the component were made at 6:06:53 AM and 6:06:59 AM; however, these final changes seem to only be minor formatting and do not change the overall functionality.

Initially, `ProductCard.tsx` displayed basic product information (image, title, price, rating, and category).  The major update introduced a login dialog.  This dialog is triggered when an unauthenticated user tries to interact with the product card (e.g., clicking to view details or add to cart).  The dialog uses React's `useState` hook to manage its visibility, along with user credentials and a pending product ID to redirect to the product page after successful login. It leverages Redux-like state management via `useAppSelector` and `useAppDispatch` to handle authentication using a `loginUser` action. Error handling is incorporated using `selectAuthError` and `clearError`.  The final version of the component includes styling using Tailwind CSS classes for layout and visual appeal. The changes from 6:06:53 AM and 6:06:59 AM appear to be negligible stylistic changes, primarily involving whitespace differences.  The core functionality remained consistent across those two commits.


## 8:18:35 AM
The `c:\projects\storefront-coupon\src\app\products\[id]\page.tsx` file underwent two significant code changes on June 25th, 2025.

The first change (7:37:55 AM) introduced a comprehensive product details page component.  This component fetches product data using Redux, handles adding items to the cart (including optimistic updates and user authentication checks), and incorporates features for wishlisting and sharing.  Error handling and loading states are implemented, along with UI elements for quantity adjustments and user feedback.  The component also includes user authentication checks for cart and wishlist actions, redirecting to the login page if necessary.  Detailed logging of cart additions, including user information, is included.

The second change (7:42:23 AM) refined the component.  The most notable difference is the removal of  `selectIsAuthenticated`, `selectCurrentUser`, and `selectAuthLoading` from the Redux store imports and the simplification of the authentication check within the `handleAddToCart` and `handleWishlist` functions. These functions now contain `TODO` comments indicating that user ID integration is pending.  The UI was also enhanced with added success and error notifications, styled with animation, and improved visual feedback.  The `lucide-react` import list was also slightly modified, removing `User` and `AlertCircle` icons.  The overall code became slightly cleaner and more concise while retaining the core functionality.  The authentication features were temporarily removed but the structure remains allowing for future integration.
