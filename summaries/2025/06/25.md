# Activity Summary for 6/25/2025

## 7:18:37 AM
The log shows a series of modifications to the `ProductCard.tsx` component within a storefront application.  There were no changes to `ProductDetails.tsx`. The `ProductCard.tsx` file underwent significant changes between 6:00:16 AM and 6:01:07 AM, adding authentication functionality.  Further minor refinements to the component were made at 6:06:53 AM and 6:06:59 AM; however, these final changes seem to only be minor formatting and do not change the overall functionality.

Initially, `ProductCard.tsx` displayed basic product information (image, title, price, rating, and category).  The major update introduced a login dialog.  This dialog is triggered when an unauthenticated user tries to interact with the product card (e.g., clicking to view details or add to cart).  The dialog uses React's `useState` hook to manage its visibility, along with user credentials and a pending product ID to redirect to the product page after successful login. It leverages Redux-like state management via `useAppSelector` and `useAppDispatch` to handle authentication using a `loginUser` action. Error handling is incorporated using `selectAuthError` and `clearError`.  The final version of the component includes styling using Tailwind CSS classes for layout and visual appeal. The changes from 6:06:53 AM and 6:06:59 AM appear to be negligible stylistic changes, primarily involving whitespace differences.  The core functionality remained consistent across those two commits.
