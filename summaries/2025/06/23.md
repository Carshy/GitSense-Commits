# Activity Summary for 6/23/2025

## 8:10:57 AM
The log shows two nearly identical entries for `c:\projects\storefront-coupon\src\hooks\useSpotlight.ts`.  Both entries contain the same code defining a React hook, `useSpotlight`, which manages a product spotlight display. The hook takes an array of products and categories as input, along with a configurable object (`SpotlightConfig`) that controls the animation (interval, flicker duration, and autoplay).  The hook creates a cycling spotlight effect, changing between images and including a brief flicker animation.

The timestamps are 6/23/2025, 7:34:04 AM and 6/23/2025, 7:34:13 AM, indicating a minor, likely inconsequential change between versions within a 9-second window.  The code itself remains unchanged between these two versions.  There are no discernible patterns or recurring elements beyond the core functionality of the `useSpotlight` hook.


## 9:11:03 AM
The log shows extensive development on a spotlight feature for an e-commerce storefront, primarily focusing on the `useSpotlight` hook and its integration into the `Spotlight` component.  The `useSpotlight` hook underwent significant revisions between 8:12 AM and 8:38 AM. Initially, it featured a single global `isVisible` state for flicker effects and hardcoded category-specific intervals.  Subsequent changes introduced category-specific `isVisible` states and a dynamic interval generation mechanism (`generateCategoryIntervals` function added at 8:26 AM), allowing for individual flicker effects and varied display speeds for different product categories.  Multiple commits between 8:15 AM and 8:20 AM refined this dynamic interval management, primarily focused on efficient timer management using `useRef` for better performance and cleanup.  The default intervals were also adjusted in several commits (8:38 AM onwards).

The `Spotlight` component (`src\components\home\spotlight.tsx`) remained largely consistent, primarily incorporating updates from the `useSpotlight` hook.  Changes in the component reflected the modifications in the hook: initially displaying a single global flicker, then transitioning to independent category-specific flicker effects. A minor visual adjustment to the `Sparkles` icon color was made at 9:07 AM.

The `HomePage` component (`src\app\page.tsx`) was updated several times between 8:48 AM and 9:03 AM, mainly involving styling changes.  Specifically, the color of the "Stats Section" background was changed from `red-500` to `orange-500` around 8:55 AM, and then the "View All Products" button's background color was modified to orange at 9:00 AM, highlighting a potential shift in the brand's color scheme. The "Subscribe" button in the newsletter section experienced similar color changes.

The `HotProducts` component (`src\components\home\HotProducts.tsx`) added error handling and loading indicators between 8:56 AM and 8:56 AM, enhancing user experience.  Lastly, a custom orange color (`custom-orange`) was added to the `tailwind.config.js` file at 8:51 AM, potentially corresponding to the color scheme changes observed in the `HomePage` component.  The header component (`src\components\layout\Header.tsx`) added around 9:04 AM features for category selection and search functionality.  A footer component (`src\components\layout\Footer.tsx`) was added at 8:57 AM, providing standard links and contact information.


## 10:10:58 AM
The log shows multiple updates to the `storefront-coupon` project on June 23, 2025.  The key changes revolve around the homepage (`page.tsx`), header (`Header.tsx`), and footer (`Footer.tsx`) components, along with a `spotlight` component showcasing products.

**`c:\projects\storefront-coupon\src\app\page.tsx`**: This file underwent several revisions between 9:49 AM and 10:10 AM. The main change involved adjusting the filtering logic for "Trending Products." Initially, products with a rating of 4.0 or higher were displayed (9:49 AM). This was later modified to include products with ratings of 3.0 or higher (10:10 AM) and then further refined to 3.5 or higher (10:10:19 AM).  The number of trending products displayed also fluctuated between 8 and 9.


**`c:\projects\storefront-coupon\src\components\layout\Footer.tsx`**:  This component was updated twice within a short time frame (9:50 AM - 9:51 AM). The primary change involved replacing "ModernStore" with "LuxeLine" in the footer's company information and updating the contact email address from `support@modernstore.com` to `support@luxeline.com`. This suggests a potential rebranding effort.

**`c:\projects\storefront-coupon\src\components\layout\Header.tsx`**: This file was modified between 9:53 AM and 9:56 AM. The most significant change was updating the logo's hover effect color from `text-blue-700` to `text-orange-600`, maintaining consistency with the brand's color scheme.  The cart icon's hover color also changed from `text-blue-600` to `text-orange-600`.  Additionally, the cart notification background color changed from red to orange.

**`c:\projects\storefront-coupon\src\components\home\spotlight.tsx`**: This component, added at 10:04 AM, displays a rotating spotlight of products.  The code includes extensive logging for debugging purposes, error handling for image loading, and a visual loading indicator.  It's designed to showcase products grouped by category, using a custom hook (`useSpotlight`) to manage the spotlight's animation and product display.  A second update (10:06 AM) didn't appear to change functionality.


Recurring patterns include consistent use of Tailwind CSS classes for styling, the `lucide-react` library for icons, and `next/link` and `next/navigation` for routing. The frequent updates suggest active development and iterative improvements to the user interface.
