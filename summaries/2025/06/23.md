# Activity Summary for 6/23/2025

## 8:10:57 AM
The log shows two nearly identical entries for `c:\projects\storefront-coupon\src\hooks\useSpotlight.ts`.  Both entries contain the same code defining a React hook, `useSpotlight`, which manages a product spotlight display. The hook takes an array of products and categories as input, along with a configurable object (`SpotlightConfig`) that controls the animation (interval, flicker duration, and autoplay).  The hook creates a cycling spotlight effect, changing between images and including a brief flicker animation.

The timestamps are 6/23/2025, 7:34:04 AM and 6/23/2025, 7:34:13 AM, indicating a minor, likely inconsequential change between versions within a 9-second window.  The code itself remains unchanged between these two versions.  There are no discernible patterns or recurring elements beyond the core functionality of the `useSpotlight` hook.
