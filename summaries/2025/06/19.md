# Activity Summary for 6/19/2025

## 12:13:29 AM
The log shows the iterative development of a JavaScript function `stairCase` that prints a staircase pattern of size 'n'.  The initial changes (between 11:19 PM and 11:20 PM) focused on defining the function signature and basic structure.  Subsequent edits, from 11:20 PM to 11:39 PM, involved progressively building the nested loops to generate the staircase pattern.  Initially, there were errors in loop conditions and string concatenation.  Around 11:30 PM, the code began correctly printing the staircase using spaces and '#' symbols.  A key correction occurred around 11:34 PM, changing the space loop condition from `j < n - 1` to `j < n - i`, fixing the pattern's alignment.  The final changes (after 11:43 PM) removed unnecessary `return` statements and function calls, resulting in a correct and concise function that prints the staircase to the console.  The final working code uses three nested loops to handle rows, spaces, and hash characters, correctly generating the desired staircase pattern. The test case was gradually changed from 100 to 1, 3, and finally 4 to aid in the debugging process.

The log shows the evolution of a JavaScript function `stairCase` that aims to print a staircase pattern of size 'n'.  The core function logic remained consistent throughout, using nested loops to generate spaces and hashes for each row.  The primary changes centered around error handling for invalid input (n <= 0).

Initially, the code lacked input validation (7:05 AM). Subsequent edits (7:15 AM - 7:19 AM) introduced an `if` condition to check for invalid input and print an error message. The error message itself underwent several revisions, improving clarity and incorporating the invalid input value ('n').  A final correction in the spacing loop (7:47 AM) changed `j < n - i` to `j < i - 1`, indicating a likely bug fix in the staircase generation. Throughout the process, the function was repeatedly called with `stairCase(-2)`, demonstrating consistent testing of the error handling logic.  There were several minor edits to the error message string between 7:16 and 7:19 AM.
