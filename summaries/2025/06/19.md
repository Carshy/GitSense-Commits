# Activity Summary for 6/19/2025

## 12:13:29 AM
The log shows the iterative development of a JavaScript function `stairCase` that prints a staircase pattern of size 'n'.  The initial changes (between 11:19 PM and 11:20 PM) focused on defining the function signature and basic structure.  Subsequent edits, from 11:20 PM to 11:39 PM, involved progressively building the nested loops to generate the staircase pattern.  Initially, there were errors in loop conditions and string concatenation.  Around 11:30 PM, the code began correctly printing the staircase using spaces and '#' symbols.  A key correction occurred around 11:34 PM, changing the space loop condition from `j < n - 1` to `j < n - i`, fixing the pattern's alignment.  The final changes (after 11:43 PM) removed unnecessary `return` statements and function calls, resulting in a correct and concise function that prints the staircase to the console.  The final working code uses three nested loops to handle rows, spaces, and hash characters, correctly generating the desired staircase pattern. The test case was gradually changed from 100 to 1, 3, and finally 4 to aid in the debugging process.


## 7:47:46 AM
The log shows the evolution of a JavaScript function `stairCase` that aims to print a staircase pattern of size 'n'.  The core function logic remained consistent throughout, using nested loops to generate spaces and hashes for each row.  The primary changes centered around error handling for invalid input (n <= 0).

Initially, the code lacked input validation (7:05 AM). Subsequent edits (7:15 AM - 7:19 AM) introduced an `if` condition to check for invalid input and print an error message. The error message itself underwent several revisions, improving clarity and incorporating the invalid input value ('n').  A final correction in the spacing loop (7:47 AM) changed `j < n - i` to `j < i - 1`, indicating a likely bug fix in the staircase generation. Throughout the process, the function was repeatedly called with `stairCase(-2)`, demonstrating consistent testing of the error handling logic.  There were several minor edits to the error message string between 7:16 and 7:19 AM.


## 8:47:47 AM
The log shows development of two JavaScript functions to print staircases.

The `staircase.js` file underwent multiple revisions between 7:48 AM and 7:53 AM on June 19, 2025.  The core changes involved refining the logic of a `stairCase` function that takes an integer `n` as input. Initially, there were errors in the nested loops responsible for generating spaces and hashes. The final version correctly calculates and prints a staircase pattern using nested loops and string repetition. The input validation also remained consistent throughout the edits.  The function was initially tested with a negative input, and later with a positive input (4).

The `staircase2.js` file shows the iterative development of a second `stairCase` function, starting from an empty function at 8:33 AM and evolving until 8:47 AM on the same day.  This function also creates a staircase pattern. The development process involved:
    *  Incremental addition of loop structures.
    *  Correcting the use of  `''.repeat()` for spaces and hashes.
    *  Debugging the concatenation and order of spaces and hashes in the `console.log` statement.
    * A brief exploration of a separate `staircaseAlterna` function before reverting back to the primary `stairCase` function and removing commented-out code.

There is a clear pattern of iterative development and debugging in both files, with multiple commits reflecting small changes and refinements over a short period.  The `staircase2.js` file shows a more verbose development process, with many intermediary commits reflecting the step-by-step construction of the function.  Both functions ultimately achieve the same goal—printing a staircase pattern—but use slightly different approaches.  The primary difference is in the way spaces and hashes are generated and concatenated, using `repeat()` and manual string concatenation.


## 9:47:46 AM
The log shows multiple revisions of a JavaScript function `stairCase` designed to print a staircase pattern.  The core logic remained consistent throughout: using nested loops and the `repeat()` method to generate spaces and hash characters.

The initial versions (8:47:57 AM and 8:48:06 AM) experimented with the order of spaces and hashes in the output.  Between 8:48:21 AM and 8:48:53 AM, the code was heavily commented, with some minor formatting changes and a brief period where the function was completely commented out.  The placement of spaces and hashes was further refined, eventually settling on the correct order (spaces followed by hashes) around 8:48:48 AM. A brief deviation occurred at 8:49:26 AM where only spaces were printed,  before reverting back to the correct output at 8:49:44 AM. The final version at 8:54:38 AM introduced a minor change, replacing `''` with `' '` for the spaces, ensuring proper spacing in the output.  The changes primarily involved debugging and refining the output of the staircase pattern.  There was a period of commenting and uncommenting the code around 8:48 AM. The `stairCase(4)` function call remained unchanged throughout, suggesting the developer consistently tested with an input of 4.
