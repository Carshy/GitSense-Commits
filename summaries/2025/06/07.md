# Activity Summary for 6/7/2025

## 12:52:14 PM
The log shows updates to two files: `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/personal/tell_media_admin/src/components/profiles/UserProfile.tsx` and `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/personal/tell_media_admin/src/app/users/layout.tsx`.

The `UserProfile.tsx` file was modified twice on June 7th, 2025, within a minute of each other (12:03:55 PM and 12:04:54 PM).  The changes seem to be focused primarily on styling. The first revision shows a mostly complete component rendering user profile information. The second revision appears to be a minor change, altering the background color of a profile summary card from `white` to `red`. The component displays user profile data (name, role, contact details, personal information, emergency contact, and employment details) using a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes.  Data is fetched from a Redux store, using `useAppSelector` and `useAppDispatch`.  Default values are in place if data is not available from the store.

The `layout.tsx` file was updated once on June 7th, 2025 at 12:14:42 PM. This file implements a responsive admin dashboard layout, including a sidebar with navigation links, a header, and a main content area.  The sidebar is collapsible on smaller screens and dynamically updates its state based on screen size. The component uses Next.js's `useRouter` and `usePathname` hooks for navigation and path management. It also leverages Redux via `useAppSelector` and `useAppDispatch` to manage authentication state and user profile data.  Conditional rendering is used to handle different user roles, redirecting users to appropriate dashboards based on their roles (admin, moderator, or writer) and showing a loading indicator if role determination is pending.  The component includes a user profile picture, and defaults to a placeholder if no profile picture is available.  Navigation items are defined in a `navItems` array, making the component maintainable and adaptable.
