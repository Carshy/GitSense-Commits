# Activity Summary for 6/7/2025

## 12:52:14 PM
The log shows updates to two files: `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/personal/tell_media_admin/src/components/profiles/UserProfile.tsx` and `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/personal/tell_media_admin/src/app/users/layout.tsx`.

The `UserProfile.tsx` file was modified twice on June 7th, 2025, within a minute of each other (12:03:55 PM and 12:04:54 PM).  The changes seem to be focused primarily on styling. The first revision shows a mostly complete component rendering user profile information. The second revision appears to be a minor change, altering the background color of a profile summary card from `white` to `red`. The component displays user profile data (name, role, contact details, personal information, emergency contact, and employment details) using a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes.  Data is fetched from a Redux store, using `useAppSelector` and `useAppDispatch`.  Default values are in place if data is not available from the store.

The `layout.tsx` file was updated once on June 7th, 2025 at 12:14:42 PM. This file implements a responsive admin dashboard layout, including a sidebar with navigation links, a header, and a main content area.  The sidebar is collapsible on smaller screens and dynamically updates its state based on screen size. The component uses Next.js's `useRouter` and `usePathname` hooks for navigation and path management. It also leverages Redux via `useAppSelector` and `useAppDispatch` to manage authentication state and user profile data.  Conditional rendering is used to handle different user roles, redirecting users to appropriate dashboards based on their roles (admin, moderator, or writer) and showing a loading indicator if role determination is pending.  The component includes a user profile picture, and defaults to a placeholder if no profile picture is available.  Navigation items are defined in a `navItems` array, making the component maintainable and adaptable.


## 1:52:14 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/personal/tell_media_admin/src/components/profiles/UserProfile.tsx`, a React component displaying user profiles.  The main focus of the changes is the UI, particularly the styling and layout for different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).


The first two commits (1:19:03 PM and 1:19:47 PM) involve primarily styling adjustments.  The second commit specifically modifies the background color of the profile picture container from `white` to `gray-200`.  These changes suggest iterative improvements to the visual presentation of the component.


The third commit (1:26:59 PM) adds `console.log` statements to display the `user` and `profile` data, likely for debugging purposes.  This suggests a development phase focused on data retrieval and display.


The final commit (1:45:29 PM) refactors the debugging `console.log` calls into `useEffect` hooks with dependencies on `user` and `profile` respectively, making the logging more efficient and reactive to data changes.  This indicates a move towards a more refined and maintainable codebase.

Throughout all commits, the structure of the component remains consistent, focusing on sections for profile summary, bio, personal information, emergency contact, and employment details.  The code uses tailwind CSS for styling and Lucide React for icons.


## 4:56:49 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to the `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/personal/tell_media_admin/src/components/profiles/UserProfile.tsx` file and the `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/personal/tell_media_admin/next.config.ts` file.

The `UserProfile.tsx` component underwent significant changes between 4:21:46 PM and 4:50:53 PM on June 7th, 2025.  Initially, the component used mock data for user profile information.  Subsequent changes integrated Redux, using `useAppSelector` and `useAppDispatch` hooks to fetch `user` and `profile` data from the Redux store's `auth` and `profile` reducers respectively.  The `profileData` object was modified to retrieve data from the Redux store rather than from mock objects.  The changes also include the addition of `useEffect` hooks to log user and profile data whenever these change,  presumably for debugging purposes. The UI itself, which displays user profile information in a responsive design, remained largely unchanged across these revisions.

The `next.config.ts` file shows two identical entries at 4:46:49 PM and 4:46:54 PM, indicating a possible accidental duplicate commit or a very minor, inconsequential change between those timestamps. The configuration file enables `reactStrictMode: false` and specifies `localhost` as an allowed image domain.
