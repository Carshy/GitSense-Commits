# Activity Summary for 6/5/2025

## 9:16:42 AM
The log shows two revisions of the `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/messe-frankfurt-admin/package.json` file.  Both revisions are nearly identical, representing a Nuxt.js project.  The key difference between the revisions (occurring between 8:22:19 AM and 8:28:40 AM on June 5th, 2025) lies within the `dependencies` section.  Specifically, the `@nathangroup/leave` package was updated from version `1.0.1` to `^5.1.3`.  All other dependencies and scripts remained unchanged.  The `package.json` file describes a project using various Vue.js components,  chart libraries, and other tools.  The scripts show configurations for development, staging, and production environments.


## 12:40:51 PM
The log shows multiple updates to a `.env` file between 11:48:55 AM and 12:05:44 PM on June 5th, 2025.  The changes primarily involve the `DATABASE_URL` variable.  Initially, multiple commented-out `DATABASE_URL` options existed,  with one active connection string. Between the first and second timestamps, a seemingly redundant `DATABASE_URL` entry was added, then subsequently removed in the final update. The rest of the environment variables, including connection strings to other databases (e.g., `MOBILE_CENTRAL_DB`, `QUEUE_DATABASE_URL`, `DATABASE_URL_CENTRAL`), API URLs, AWS credentials, and other configuration settings, remained largely consistent across all revisions.  No significant patterns or recurring alterations are observed beyond the modifications to the `DATABASE_URL`.
