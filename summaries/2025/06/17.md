# Activity Summary for 6/17/2025

## 8:23:26 AM
The log shows development of two JavaScript functions: `validEl` and `removeDuplicates`.

`1. Remove Element.js` contains the `validEl` function which removes all occurrences of a specified value (`val`) from an integer array (`nums`). It returns the number of elements remaining after removal.  This function was completed at 6/17/2025, 5:24:47 AM and remained unchanged.


`2. Remove Duplicates.js` contains the `removeDuplicates` function. This function removes duplicates from a sorted integer array, keeping only the first occurrence of each unique element.  The function's development is tracked across several commits between 5:56:54 AM and 6:00:22 AM. Initially, the function was commented out. The commits show incremental development of the `removeDuplicates` function, starting with an empty function body and gradually adding the core logic of iterating through the array and only copying unique elements to the beginning of the array.  The final version of the code, completed at 6:00:22 AM, correctly implements the required functionality.  The repeated changes suggest iterative debugging and refinement of the algorithm.  The commented-out code blocks represent earlier attempts at the solution.
