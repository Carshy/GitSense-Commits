# Activity Summary for 6/20/2025

## 8:46:57 AM
The log shows the development of a JavaScript function `validEl` that removes all occurrences of a given integer `val` from an integer array `nums` and returns the number of remaining elements.

The file `c:\projects\Musoko-DSA-Series\Arrays_and_Strings\1. Remove Element.js` is the subject of the changes.  The initial log entries (8:09:08 AM - 8:12:41 AM) demonstrate iterative refinement of the function's implementation.  Initially, the function body is empty or contains incomplete code.  Between 8:12:41 AM and 8:13:04 AM, the core logic (iterating through the array and moving non-`val` elements to the beginning) is implemented.  A minor correction involving incrementing the `k` variable correctly is made between 8:13:04 AM and 8:13:33 AM, leading to a functional version. Finally, a minor formatting adjustment is made between 8:13:33 AM and 8:17:19 AM.  The final version of the function correctly removes elements and returns the count of remaining elements.  The time between 8:12:41 AM and 8:13:33 AM represents the most significant changes in the code's functionality.  The commented-out code sections are a possible previous attempt at solving the problem.  The pattern shows a debugging process of implementing a loop with a conditional to filter and reorder elements within the array.
