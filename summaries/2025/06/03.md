# Activity Summary for 6/3/2025

## 10:02:44 AM
The provided log shows two revisions of `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/payfuture-hrms-admin/components/admin-central/employmentnew.vue`, a Vue component.  Both revisions are nearly identical, suggesting only minor, non-substantial changes were made between 9:48:37 AM and 9:52:04 AM on June 3rd, 2025.  The core functionality of the component, which appears to be an employee management interface, remains unchanged. The component includes features for adding new users, searching employees, displaying employee statistics (male/female counts), bulk attendance updates, downloading employee data, and advanced filtering. The advanced filtering allows for filtering by employee ID, status, name, email, designation, department, cost center, and date of joining/leaving.  The lack of substantial difference between the two revisions indicates that the commit history likely contains further changes that aren't captured in this log snippet.
