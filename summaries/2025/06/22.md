# Activity Summary for 6/22/2025

## 6:14:08 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to `EnhancedHeroSection.tsx` between 5:37 AM and 6:13 AM on June 22, 2025.  The file is a React component rendering a hero section with three columns: offers, an image carousel, and featured products.

The earliest revisions (5:37 AM and 5:38 AM) focused on fixing image references within the `carouselData` array and restructuring the layout.  A significant change occurred around 5:38 AM, where the left column (offers) was redesigned from a single card to a display of multiple offers, limited to six, using a map function for improved structure and potentially better reusability.

Further revisions between 5:39 AM and 6:13 AM concentrated primarily on stylistic changes to the left column's presentation. These changes involved altering colors (`from-pink-50 to-pink-100` to `from-rose-50/80 to-pink-50/80`), adding subtle visual effects (shimmer, subtle decorative elements, refined border, inner highlight), and refining the layout and typography (font sizes, spacing, etc.). The changes suggest a shift towards a more refined and visually appealing design. The percentage symbol's position within the discount display also underwent minor adjustments in the final revisions.  The overall style shifted from a pink theme to a more neutral gray and rose color scheme.  No functional changes to the carousel or featured products sections were observed during this time.  The consistent use of `bg-gradient-to-br`, `backdrop-blur-sm`, and hover effects shows a recurring design pattern for visual enhancement throughout the component.
