# Activity Summary for 6/22/2025

## 6:14:08 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to `EnhancedHeroSection.tsx` between 5:37 AM and 6:13 AM on June 22, 2025.  The file is a React component rendering a hero section with three columns: offers, an image carousel, and featured products.

The earliest revisions (5:37 AM and 5:38 AM) focused on fixing image references within the `carouselData` array and restructuring the layout.  A significant change occurred around 5:38 AM, where the left column (offers) was redesigned from a single card to a display of multiple offers, limited to six, using a map function for improved structure and potentially better reusability.

Further revisions between 5:39 AM and 6:13 AM concentrated primarily on stylistic changes to the left column's presentation. These changes involved altering colors (`from-pink-50 to-pink-100` to `from-rose-50/80 to-pink-50/80`), adding subtle visual effects (shimmer, subtle decorative elements, refined border, inner highlight), and refining the layout and typography (font sizes, spacing, etc.). The changes suggest a shift towards a more refined and visually appealing design. The percentage symbol's position within the discount display also underwent minor adjustments in the final revisions.  The overall style shifted from a pink theme to a more neutral gray and rose color scheme.  No functional changes to the carousel or featured products sections were observed during this time.  The consistent use of `bg-gradient-to-br`, `backdrop-blur-sm`, and hover effects shows a recurring design pattern for visual enhancement throughout the component.


## 9:53:01 AM
The log shows numerous revisions to the `EnhancedHeroSection.tsx` component between 6:15 AM and 9:20 AM on June 22, 2025.  The primary focus of the changes is enhancing the responsiveness and visual appeal of the component, particularly its layout and styling.

Early revisions (6:15 AM - 6:17 AM) centered around fixing image references within the `carouselData` array and involved minor adjustments to the styling and structure of the offer section.  There were also several duplicated offer sections which were eventually removed in later revisions.

Subsequent changes (6:17 AM - 6:27 AM) focused on refining the layout of the offers section, experimenting with different approaches (adding background colors and padding) before settling on a design using a `bg-white rounded-xl p-4 shadow-md` container for improved visual separation and better responsiveness.

Significant modifications occurred between 6:33 AM and 9:20 AM.  The component was redesigned to utilize a responsive 12-column grid layout (`lg:grid lg:grid-cols-12`) using Tailwind CSS utility classes.  This improved the responsiveness of the component across different screen sizes, adapting the layout to stack on smaller screens and switching to a grid layout on larger screens.  This included adjusting sizes and positioning of elements like offers, carousel, and navigation buttons using  `w-full`, `lg:w-72`, `min-h-[280px]`, `sm:min-h-[320px]`, `lg:min-h-[300px]`, and similar Tailwind classes for responsive design.  The height of the container was also adjusted (`h-[300px]`, `h-[400px]` ) for optimal appearance.

Finally,  the font sizes and spacing within the offer and carousel sections were repeatedly adjusted to improve visual clarity and hierarchy across different screen sizes, using Tailwind's responsive modifiers (e.g., `text-xl sm:text-2xl`). The `Lucide-react` icons were consistently used throughout, adding to the visual consistency of the component. The final revision at 9:20 AM represents a more refined and responsive component compared to the initial version.  The overall changes demonstrate an iterative design process focused on creating a visually appealing and user-friendly hero section suitable for various screen sizes.


## 11:07:20 AM
The log shows multiple edits to `EnhancedHeroSection.tsx` between 10:07 AM and 11:07 AM on June 22, 2025.  The primary focus of the changes is improving the responsiveness and styling of the component, which renders a hero section with a carousel and promotional offers.

The initial version (10:07 AM) established the basic layout using Tailwind CSS classes.  It included a carousel of fashion images, a left-hand column with offers and a coupon code, and a right-hand column displaying an image carousel.  

Subsequent edits (10:19 AM, 10:22 AM) focused on making the layout more responsive across different screen sizes by adjusting padding, margins, and using `clamp()` for font sizes and other dimensions. This ensured better scaling across various devices.  The 10:22 AM revision reverted some of the responsiveness changes made in the 10:19 AM revision, returning to a more fixed layout structure.


The revisions at 10:26 AM and 10:31 AM adjusted the height of the left column and made further minor layout tweaks. The height of the main container was adjusted to `18rem` for better visual consistency.

The most significant changes happened between 10:34 AM and 10:49 AM.  These revisions refined the styling and responsiveness of individual elements within the left column (offers section). Font sizes were reduced and padding adjusted for improved readability.

The final changes (10:49 AM-11:07 AM) involved minor adjustments to the layout and text sizes, resulting in a more compact and consistent look for smaller screens.  The only functional change was a replacement of one image file, changing `img6.jpg` to `img6.png`.  Throughout the edits, the code consistently leveraged Tailwind CSS classes for styling and responsive design.  The auto-slide carousel functionality remained unchanged throughout the entire process.


## 12:34:29 PM
The log shows multiple edits to `EnhancedHeroSection.tsx` between 11:38 AM and 12:14 PM on June 22, 2025.  The core component remains largely unchanged throughout these edits, focusing on a hero section with an image carousel and a promotional offers/featured products layout.

The initial commits (11:38 AM and 11:39 AM)  appear to be near-identical, suggesting a possible accidental duplicate or a minor, inconsequential change that's not reflected in the diff.  Subsequent commits show no changes to the core functionality but add a right-hand column.

At 12:11:48 PM, a significant change was made, adding a "Featured Products" section to the right column of the component. This section displays a grid of products fetched from the Redux store (`useAppSelector`).  This new section includes product images, titles, prices (formatted using `Intl.NumberFormat`), ratings, and a "View All Products" link.  The styling of this new section is extensive, using Tailwind CSS classes to control layout, appearance, and responsiveness.

The final commit at 12:14:31 PM shows no further structural or functional changes; only minor changes or formatting adjustments.  The code consistently uses React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`), Next.js components (`Link`, `Image`), and Lucide React icons for styling.  The carousel data remains constant throughout the log.  The overall pattern of edits suggests iterative improvements to the styling and addition of a featured products section.
