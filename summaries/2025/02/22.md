# Activity Summary for 2/22/2025

## 9:01:51 PM
The log shows several updates to the `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/apis/roche-api` project between 6:02 PM and 6:28 PM on February 21, 2025.

The `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/apis/roche-api/models/letters.js` file was modified twice within a short time frame (6:02 PM and 6:06 PM).  The changes involved updating the `manager` field in the `letterlogs` schema from an array type to a string type.  No other significant changes are observed in this file.

The `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/apis/roche-api/api/payslips.js` file underwent multiple revisions (6:09 PM, 6:10 PM, 6:16 PM, 6:26 PM, and 6:28 PM).  These changes appear to involve modifications to the `gcn` array, which contains detailed employee compensation data.  The content of the `gcn` array remains largely consistent across all revisions, suggesting iterative adjustments or additions to individual employee records rather than substantial schema changes. The use of `process.env` variables for AWS and SendGrid credentials suggests integration with those services.  The frequent updates to this file might indicate a process of data refinement or batch updates for payroll processing.
