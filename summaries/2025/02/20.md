# Activity Summary for 2/20/2025

## 9:51:42 AM
The log shows edits to `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/personal/Musoko-DSA-Series/arrays_objects/manipulations.js`.  The file contains a function `myArray` which is repeatedly modified throughout the morning of February 20th, 2025.

Initially (8:51 AM - 8:54 AM), the function attempts to manipulate array elements using `.map()`, first aiming for multiplication by 2, then by the element itself (`el * el`).  Between 8:59 AM and 9:01 AM,  the `.map()` approach is replaced with a `for` loop, again experimenting with different element transformations (multiplication by 2, then squaring, and then cubing).  A return to `.map()` occurs at 9:01 AM and continues with more experimentation until 9:04 AM.

From 9:04 AM to 9:12 AM, the focus shifts to `.filter()`. The code attempts to filter even numbers, with some unsuccessful attempts at manipulating the filtered results.  Eventually, the code successfully filters for even numbers, and then applies `.map()` to those even numbers to divide each by 2, and later attempts similar operations for odd numbers instead.

Finally, from 9:19 AM to 9:34 AM, the function's purpose changes to summing array elements.  Initially using `.reduce()`, there are several iterations to correctly implement the summation. Eventually, a `for` loop is used to achieve the same result.  The most significant changes regarding summation occurred between 9:19 AM and 9:28 AM.  There's a brief attempt at using a `for` loop method for summation at 9:32 AM which is corrected by 9:34 AM.  Throughout the entire log, the input array `[2, 23, 3, 33, 9, 10]` is consistently used for testing.
