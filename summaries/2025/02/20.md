# Activity Summary for 2/20/2025

## 9:51:42 AM
The log shows edits to `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/personal/Musoko-DSA-Series/arrays_objects/manipulations.js`.  The file contains a function `myArray` which is repeatedly modified throughout the morning of February 20th, 2025.

Initially (8:51 AM - 8:54 AM), the function attempts to manipulate array elements using `.map()`, first aiming for multiplication by 2, then by the element itself (`el * el`).  Between 8:59 AM and 9:01 AM,  the `.map()` approach is replaced with a `for` loop, again experimenting with different element transformations (multiplication by 2, then squaring, and then cubing).  A return to `.map()` occurs at 9:01 AM and continues with more experimentation until 9:04 AM.

From 9:04 AM to 9:12 AM, the focus shifts to `.filter()`. The code attempts to filter even numbers, with some unsuccessful attempts at manipulating the filtered results.  Eventually, the code successfully filters for even numbers, and then applies `.map()` to those even numbers to divide each by 2, and later attempts similar operations for odd numbers instead.

Finally, from 9:19 AM to 9:34 AM, the function's purpose changes to summing array elements.  Initially using `.reduce()`, there are several iterations to correctly implement the summation. Eventually, a `for` loop is used to achieve the same result.  The most significant changes regarding summation occurred between 9:19 AM and 9:28 AM.  There's a brief attempt at using a `for` loop method for summation at 9:32 AM which is corrected by 9:34 AM.  Throughout the entire log, the input array `[2, 23, 3, 33, 9, 10]` is consistently used for testing.


## 10:58:03 AM
The log shows two updates to the `.env` file, both on February 20, 2025.  The changes between the two timestamps are minimal.  The file contains numerous environment variables, including database connection strings (several commented out, suggesting experimentation with different databases), API keys (SENDGRID, AWS), JWT configuration details, messaging service credentials (Etisalat), application URLs, and configuration for Microsoft Azure Active Directory integration.  No substantive changes to the values of these variables are observed between the two recorded modifications. The primary focus appears to be on a staging environment, indicated by URLs like `https://hrdirect-staging.devnhr.com/` and `COMPANY_CODE='NNBABILOU-TEST_'`.  The `DATABASE_URL` variable shows multiple commented-out options, suggesting testing of various database instances.
