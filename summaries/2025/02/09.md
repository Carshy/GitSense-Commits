# Activity Summary for 2/9/2025

## 7:05:14 AM
The log shows modifications to the `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/personal/tell_a_tale_spot/tell_tales/requirements.txt` file on February 9th, 2025.  The file contains Python package dependencies.

The first two entries (6:41:45 AM and 6:41:54 AM) are almost identical, differing only by the presence of `Django==5.0.6` in the first entry. This suggests a quick reversion or an accidental addition of  `Django==5.0.6`.

The third entry (6:57:49 AM) shows a change from `psycopg2==2.9.9` to `psycopg2-binary==2.9.9`. This indicates a switch to the binary wheels version of the `psycopg2` PostgreSQL adapter, likely for improved installation or performance.  The rest of the packages remain consistent across all three revisions.  The overall pattern shows dependency management for a Django project using various testing and development tools.


## 8:05:15 AM
The log shows a single entry for `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/personal/tell_a_tale_spot/tell_tales/tell_tales/settings.py` at 2/9/2025, 7:21:20 AM.  This file contains Django project settings.  The key changes are the configuration of various Django features, including:

* **Database:** PostgreSQL is used with specified credentials (`telltales_db`, `collinsmusoko`, `Carshy`, `localhost:5432`).
* **Authentication:**  `rest_framework_simplejwt` is implemented for JWT-based authentication with a 50-minute access token lifetime and 1-day refresh token lifetime.  Token rotation and blacklisting are enabled.
* **Media:** Media files will be served from `/media/` and stored in a `media` directory within the project's base directory.
* **CORS:** CORS is enabled, allowing requests from `http://localhost:3000` (likely a React development server).  A placeholder for a production frontend domain is also present.
* **Installed Apps:** Several apps are included, indicating a potentially complex application, including  `rest_framework`, `django_filters`, and user authentication and authorization.

The settings file is a standard Django configuration, showing the project's structure and dependencies.  The timestamp indicates the settings were last modified on February 9th, 2025, at 7:21:20 AM.
