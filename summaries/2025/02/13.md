# Activity Summary for 2/13/2025

## 10:36:11 AM
The `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/sata-admin/components/datatables/salarySheetDT.vue` file was updated on February 13, 2025, at 10:32:25 AM.  This Vue component renders a data table displaying salary sheet information.  Significant changes include the addition of export functionality for XLSX and CSV files using the `SalarySheetExporter` plugin.  The table dynamically generates headers based on the `config` prop, which defines fixed, earning, and deduction fields.  The component handles data formatting (currency and color-coding based on values),  includes a search function, and displays salary adjustment alerts using tooltips. The `getHeaders` computed property dynamically builds the table headers based on the data's structure and the configuration received from props. The component fetches approver names using an API call to `/users/adminCentral/user/{approver_id}` before exporting salary sheets.  The data is sorted alphabetically by first name.  The component utilizes several helper methods like `getColorForEarning`, `getColorForDeductions`, and `checkIfHasSalaryAdjustment` for data presentation and conditional rendering.  Error handling for API responses isn't explicitly shown in the provided code.
