# Activity Summary for 2/13/2025

## 10:36:11 AM
The `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/sata-admin/components/datatables/salarySheetDT.vue` file was updated on February 13, 2025, at 10:32:25 AM.  This Vue component renders a data table displaying salary sheet information.  Significant changes include the addition of export functionality for XLSX and CSV files using the `SalarySheetExporter` plugin.  The table dynamically generates headers based on the `config` prop, which defines fixed, earning, and deduction fields.  The component handles data formatting (currency and color-coding based on values),  includes a search function, and displays salary adjustment alerts using tooltips. The `getHeaders` computed property dynamically builds the table headers based on the data's structure and the configuration received from props. The component fetches approver names using an API call to `/users/adminCentral/user/{approver_id}` before exporting salary sheets.  The data is sorted alphabetically by first name.  The component utilizes several helper methods like `getColorForEarning`, `getColorForDeductions`, and `checkIfHasSalaryAdjustment` for data presentation and conditional rendering.  Error handling for API responses isn't explicitly shown in the provided code.

The log shows multiple revisions of `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/sata-admin/components/datatables/salarySheetDT.vue` on February 13th, 2025.  The file is a Vue component rendering a data table for salary sheets.

The primary changes revolve around the `exportToExcel` method.  Initially, this method was incomplete and contained commented-out code.  Subsequent revisions added error handling using `try...catch` blocks to handle potential issues during user data fetching and Excel export. The most significant change was at 11:24:49 AM and 11:25:06 AM where error handling was implemented for API calls to retrieve approver names and a fallback value was set for when a user is not found. A minor change at 11:28:46 AM was made to include nullish coalescing operator (`??`) in the `payrollData` to handle cases where `approvalsWithUsername` might be null or undefined.  This ensures that the export process does not fail due to a missing approvals array.

Throughout the revisions, the template and the `getHeaders`, `computeSalarySheetDOJ`, and `computedExportFormats` computed properties remain largely unchanged. These handle the display of the salary sheet data table, generating headers dynamically based on the configuration (`config` prop), sorting the data, and determining available export formats respectively.  The component consistently uses  `v-data-table` from the Vuetify library for data presentation and includes features like search and export functionalities (xlsx and csv).
