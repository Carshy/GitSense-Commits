# Activity Summary for 2/28/2025

## 9:50:41 AM
The log shows updates to a Vue.js application related to payroll processing.

**`/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/systra-admin/config.js` (2/28/2025, 8:59:55 AM):** This file was updated to define configurations for different environments (development, staging, preprod, production).  The configurations specify base URLs, HTTPS usage, cross-domain settings, and NUXT_PORT.  The `staging` environment uses an environment variable for `NUXT_PORT`, while `preprod` and `production` explicitly set it to `5102`.


**`/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/systra-admin/package.json` (2/28/2025, 9:00:28 AM):**  This file contains the project's metadata and dependencies.  It lists numerous packages, suggesting a complex application using Vue.js (Nuxt.js), various charting and UI libraries, and backend integrations (e.g., SendGrid, AWS SDK).  The `scripts` section defines various commands for development, build processes for different environments, and starting the application in each environment.  Memory allocation via `NODE_OPTIONS` is adjusted based on the environment.


**`/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/systra-admin/pages/payroll/_id.vue` (2/28/2025, 9:34:49 AM, 9:36:11 AM, 9:42:32 AM):**  This component is the primary focus of the updates, demonstrating iterative development.  The component manages the approval workflow for payroll sheets. Key features include:

* **Approval/Rejection:** Buttons to approve or reject payroll sheets, requiring comments.
* **Submission:**  A dialog to submit the sheet for approval.
* **Approval Status Tracking:** Displays a history of approvers, their statuses (Approved/Rejected), comments, and dates. Uses `services_general` for fetching user names and avatars.
* **Closing Sheet:** A dialog to close the payroll sheet, indicating payslip generation.
* **Report Generation:** Buttons to download payroll reports (possibly in SIF and Excel formats).
* **Conditional Rendering:** Extensive use of `v-if` directives to show/hide UI elements based on the sheet status (`active`/`inactive`), approval status, and user permissions (`submissionAccess`, `approvalAccess`, `approveRejectFlag`).

The component's code undergoes multiple minor revisions over a short period.  The primary changes seem to be related to the display of the SIF download button, making it always visible if the `payrollprocesses[0].status` is `inactive` and minor updates to conditional rendering. The final update seems to introduce an error  as it truncates the code unexpectedly.

The provided log shows two entries for the `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/apis/systra-api/.env` file, both at 2/28/2025, with a 15-second difference between them.  The content of the `.env` file is identical in both entries.  The file contains numerous environment variables, including database connection strings for various environments (staging, production, pre-prod),  SendGrid API key, JWT keys, AWS credentials, messaging service credentials (Etisalat), URLs for various services, client settings, and Microsoft OAuth configuration.  Many variables have commented-out alternatives, suggesting that configurations can be easily switched.  There's also a company code variable which seems to indicate a staging environment ('NNSYSTRAUAE-TEST_').  The most significant change between the two entries appears to be just the timestamps, indicating no actual content modification.
