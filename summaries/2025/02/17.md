# Activity Summary for 2/17/2025

## 10:10:16 AM
The `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/sata-admin/plugins/salary-sheet.js` file was updated on February 17, 2025, at 9:50:51 AM.  The update significantly alters the `handleSalarySheetData` function, which now generates an Excel salary sheet.  Key changes include:

* **Improved Header Configuration:** The function `handleHeaderConfig` now allows for more flexible header configuration, including the option to include a company logo, company name, and pay month.

* **Enhanced Data Handling:** The core logic of `handleSalarySheetData` processes salary data, grouping employees by team ("team" column is explicitly removed before processing).  It dynamically generates columns based on configuration (`payrollConfig`), applying custom styling and formatting. Each team gets its own section with a header, and totals are calculated for each team and optionally a grand total.

* **Detailed Styling and Formatting:**  Extensive styling is applied to various elements, including headers, team headers (bold, underlined, indented, color-coded), totals rows (red text), and data rows (thin borders).  Cell alignment, font sizes, and colors are meticulously controlled.

* **Error Handling (Implicit):** While not explicitly shown, the use of optional chaining (`??`) and nullish coalescing suggests some level of error handling for missing or unexpected data in `payrollConfig` and `payrollProcess`.

* **Data Aggregation:** The code efficiently aggregates data to calculate team and grand totals, displaying them in a designated row.  Only numeric columns are summed.

The code utilizes the `exceljs` and `moment` libraries for Excel workbook creation and date formatting, respectively.  A base64 encoded company logo is included as an asset. The overall structure is well-organized into separate functions for better readability and maintainability.  The absence of error handling mechanisms might be an area for improvement.
