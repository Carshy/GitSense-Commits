# Activity Summary for 2/11/2025

## 10:21:51 AM
The log shows multiple revisions of `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/sata-admin/components/datatables/salarySheetDT.vue` between 9:41 AM and 9:46 AM on February 11, 2025.  The changes primarily focus on the `exportToExcel` method within the `<script>` section.

The initial versions show the method fetching a token from the Vuex store (`this.$store.getters.getToken`) and using it to make an API call to `/users/adminCentral/user/{approver_id[0]}` to retrieve approver names for a salary sheet.  The  `console.log` statement within this method was modified several times, changing from logging just `Get the token` to logging the token itself (`"Show the token Here=>*********", token`). This suggests debugging efforts to ensure the token is correctly retrieved and used in the API request.  No other functional changes are apparent in the component's template or other methods across the revisions.  The file consistently exports salary sheets in xlsx and csv formats, as determined by the `computedExportFormats` computed property.  The `getHeaders` computed property dynamically generates table headers based on the `config` prop, catering for earnings, deductions, and fixed values.  The component uses a `v-data-table` for displaying the salary sheet data and includes a search functionality.
