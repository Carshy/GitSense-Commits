# Activity Summary for 2/11/2025

## 10:21:51 AM
The log shows multiple revisions of `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/sata-admin/components/datatables/salarySheetDT.vue` between 9:41 AM and 9:46 AM on February 11, 2025.  The changes primarily focus on the `exportToExcel` method within the `<script>` section.

The initial versions show the method fetching a token from the Vuex store (`this.$store.getters.getToken`) and using it to make an API call to `/users/adminCentral/user/{approver_id[0]}` to retrieve approver names for a salary sheet.  The  `console.log` statement within this method was modified several times, changing from logging just `Get the token` to logging the token itself (`"Show the token Here=>*********", token`). This suggests debugging efforts to ensure the token is correctly retrieved and used in the API request.  No other functional changes are apparent in the component's template or other methods across the revisions.  The file consistently exports salary sheets in xlsx and csv formats, as determined by the `computedExportFormats` computed property.  The `getHeaders` computed property dynamically generates table headers based on the `config` prop, catering for earnings, deductions, and fixed values.  The component uses a `v-data-table` for displaying the salary sheet data and includes a search functionality.


## 11:41:09 AM
The log shows two revisions of `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/cybergate-admin/pages/payroll/_id.vue`, a Vue component likely for payroll management.  Both revisions, at 11:26:08 AM and 11:28:16 AM on February 11, 2025, are nearly identical. The changes between the two commits are minimal and not readily apparent from a diff.

The component displays a payroll sheet using a `v-data-table`.  Each row represents a payroll process run, showing details like creation date (`item.createdDate`), type (`item.type`), status (`item.status`), and provides multiple action buttons.

Actions include: generating supplementary payrolls, adding new pay items (`AddNewPayitem`, `AddNewPayitemOffCycle`), generating company-wise reports and general salary sheets, approval requests (with a badge for pending approvals), withholding employee salaries, submitting for approval, approving/rejecting submissions, downloading SIF files (both standard and Excel formats), viewing logs, and sending emails for End-of-Service details.  The actions are conditional based on the payroll run's status (`item.status`), type (`item.type`), and approval status (`item.submit_for_approval`).  The component extensively uses Vuetify components (`v-card`, `v-btn`, `v-tooltip`, `v-img`, `v-chip`, `v-data-table`, `v-badge`, `v-icon`), suggesting a reliance on this UI framework.  The code suggests a robust workflow for managing payroll processes with a focus on approvals and reporting.
