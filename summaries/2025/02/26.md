# Activity Summary for 2/26/2025

## 6:06:46 AM
The log shows development on a Django application's user management system between 5:35 AM and 5:44 AM on February 26th, 2025.  The key changes center around user permissions and profile creation upon user registration.

`serviceUsers.py` (5:35 AM): This file defines a `UserPermissionService` class with a `set_user_permissions` method. This method assigns `is_superuser` and `is_staff` flags based on the user's `role` ('admin', 'moderator', or 'writer').  All roles are assigned `is_staff` as True.

`signals.py` (5:37 AM and 5:44 AM): This file uses Django signals to manage user-related actions after a user is saved.  There are four signal receivers:

* `create_user_profile`: Creates a user profile when a new user is created.
* `save_user_profile`: Saves the associated user profile.
* `assign_role_to_superuser`: Assigns the 'admin' role to newly created superusers.
* `set_user_permissions_on_save`: Calls `UserPermissionService.set_user_permissions` to set permissions based on the user's role after a user is created.

The changes between the two entries for `signals.py` (5:37 AM and 5:44 AM) are minor. The only visible difference is the import path of `UserPermissionService`, which is corrected from `./services/serviceUsers` to `users.services.serviceUsers` in the second entry, fixing a relative import issue.  The functionality remains unchanged.  The overall pattern shows a well-structured approach to user management, separating permission logic from the signal handling.


## 10:19:28 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/hecqatar-admin/components/datatables/salarySheetDT.vue`  between 9:21 AM and 9:44 AM on February 26, 2025.  These revisions primarily focus on improving the display and formatting of salary data within a Vue.js data table component.  Initial versions show a basic salary sheet with download functionality and search capabilities.  Subsequent changes introduce:

* **Improved Number Formatting:** The `formattedFigures` method is refined to handle null/undefined values and format numbers with commas as thousands separators.  This is applied to various salary fields like `basic_salary`, `housing_allowance`, and `transport_allowance`.

* **Additional Salary Fields:**  The template is updated to explicitly display `basic_salary`, `housing_allowance`, and `transport_allowance`  as separate columns in the data table.

* **Consistent Formatting:** The repeated `<template v-slot:[`item.total_earnings`]` entries are removed, addressing redundancy.

The `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/hecqatar-admin/pages/payroll/_id.vue` file is updated between 9:52 AM and 10:05 AM on the same day. These changes pertain to a payroll management page, adding features for:

* **Payroll Approval Workflow:**  Buttons for approving, rejecting, and submitting payroll sheets for approval are implemented, along with dialogs to confirm actions and display approval status.  The approval workflow tracks approver details, status, date, and comments.

* **Company Selection:** An autocomplete component lets users select a company to view its salary sheet.

* **Additional Actions:**  A menu with buttons for viewing logs, adding new pay items, and managing withheld wages is added.

* **Data Display:** The display of salary data is enhanced and improved.  There is a section showing stats summary for open/closed payroll processes.

The overall pattern in both files shows a consistent effort to enhance user interface elements related to payroll data management, focusing on improved data presentation and enhanced workflow processes for approvals and other actions.  The changes in `salarySheetDT.vue` are incremental improvements to data display, while changes to `payroll/_id.vue` represent substantial additions to the payroll management page's functionality.
