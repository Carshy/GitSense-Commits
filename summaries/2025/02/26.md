# Activity Summary for 2/26/2025

## 6:06:46 AM
The log shows development on a Django application's user management system between 5:35 AM and 5:44 AM on February 26th, 2025.  The key changes center around user permissions and profile creation upon user registration.

`serviceUsers.py` (5:35 AM): This file defines a `UserPermissionService` class with a `set_user_permissions` method. This method assigns `is_superuser` and `is_staff` flags based on the user's `role` ('admin', 'moderator', or 'writer').  All roles are assigned `is_staff` as True.

`signals.py` (5:37 AM and 5:44 AM): This file uses Django signals to manage user-related actions after a user is saved.  There are four signal receivers:

* `create_user_profile`: Creates a user profile when a new user is created.
* `save_user_profile`: Saves the associated user profile.
* `assign_role_to_superuser`: Assigns the 'admin' role to newly created superusers.
* `set_user_permissions_on_save`: Calls `UserPermissionService.set_user_permissions` to set permissions based on the user's role after a user is created.

The changes between the two entries for `signals.py` (5:37 AM and 5:44 AM) are minor. The only visible difference is the import path of `UserPermissionService`, which is corrected from `./services/serviceUsers` to `users.services.serviceUsers` in the second entry, fixing a relative import issue.  The functionality remains unchanged.  The overall pattern shows a well-structured approach to user management, separating permission logic from the signal handling.


## 10:19:28 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/hecqatar-admin/components/datatables/salarySheetDT.vue`  between 9:21 AM and 9:44 AM on February 26, 2025.  These revisions primarily focus on improving the display and formatting of salary data within a Vue.js data table component.  Initial versions show a basic salary sheet with download functionality and search capabilities.  Subsequent changes introduce:

* **Improved Number Formatting:** The `formattedFigures` method is refined to handle null/undefined values and format numbers with commas as thousands separators.  This is applied to various salary fields like `basic_salary`, `housing_allowance`, and `transport_allowance`.

* **Additional Salary Fields:**  The template is updated to explicitly display `basic_salary`, `housing_allowance`, and `transport_allowance`  as separate columns in the data table.

* **Consistent Formatting:** The repeated `<template v-slot:[`item.total_earnings`]` entries are removed, addressing redundancy.

The `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/hecqatar-admin/pages/payroll/_id.vue` file is updated between 9:52 AM and 10:05 AM on the same day. These changes pertain to a payroll management page, adding features for:

* **Payroll Approval Workflow:**  Buttons for approving, rejecting, and submitting payroll sheets for approval are implemented, along with dialogs to confirm actions and display approval status.  The approval workflow tracks approver details, status, date, and comments.

* **Company Selection:** An autocomplete component lets users select a company to view its salary sheet.

* **Additional Actions:**  A menu with buttons for viewing logs, adding new pay items, and managing withheld wages is added.

* **Data Display:** The display of salary data is enhanced and improved.  There is a section showing stats summary for open/closed payroll processes.

The overall pattern in both files shows a consistent effort to enhance user interface elements related to payroll data management, focusing on improved data presentation and enhanced workflow processes for approvals and other actions.  The changes in `salarySheetDT.vue` are incremental improvements to data display, while changes to `payroll/_id.vue` represent substantial additions to the payroll management page's functionality.


## 11:13:52 AM
The provided log shows two revisions of a `.env` file, both occurring on February 26, 2025.  The key changes are minimal between the two timestamps (10:47:44 AM and 10:50:31 AM).  The file contains numerous environment variables, primarily related to database connections (multiple MongoDB instances), AWS credentials (commented out in both versions), SendGrid API keys, client URLs, and email configurations (SMTP settings for Mailtrap, email addresses).  There are also variables for JWT (JSON Web Tokens) configuration,  Microsoft single sign-on credentials (OAUTH), internal ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) system access, and notification service settings (including a VAPID key pair and an API key).

Between the two revisions, the only apparent change is the un-commenting of the `DATABASE_URL` pointing to `mongodb+srv://hecqatar-administartor:1lLzAofihcmq3t66@staging-01.4q4jk.mongodb.net/hecqatar`, while the line  `DATABASE_URL= mongodb+srv://hecqatar-mcs-admin:7JgsLmUvc1uhKypj@proda.bc9co.mongodb.net/hecqatar-mcs` is commented out in both revisions. This suggests a switch to a different database connection for the main application.  The rest of the environment variables remain consistent across both versions.  Many variables are commented out, suggesting they might be used in different environments or for different configurations.


## 11:19:30 AM
The log shows multiple revisions of the `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/hecqatar-admin/pages/payroll/_id.vue` file between 10:37 AM and 11:18 AM on February 26, 2025.  The changes appear to be minor edits and do not significantly alter the overall functionality.  All revisions involve the same Vue.js component focused on payroll management.  The component includes features for:

* **Approval Workflow:**  Buttons for approving, rejecting, and submitting payroll sheets for approval.  A dialog displays the approval status at each level, showing approver names, status (Approved/Rejected), dates, and comments.

* **Company Selection:** An autocomplete component allows users to select a company from `computedPayrollConfigCompanies`. A function `handleChangeSalarySheet()` is called on selection change.

* **Sheet Status:** Displays the payroll sheet's status ("Open" or "Closed") and the pay month.

* **Sheet Closure:** A "Close Sheet" button (disabled when `closebtndisabled` is true) triggers the `closeSheet()` function. A success message appears on successful closure.

* **SIF Report Download:** A download button for a SIF report is conditionally visible (`payrollprocesses[0].status == 'active' && computedShowSIF`).

* **Additional Actions Menu:** A menu with options for:
    * Opening an `ApprovalDialog` component.
    * Opening an `AddNewPayitem` component.
    * Viewing logs (`dialog_history`).
    * Viewing withheld wages (`dialog_withheld_salary`).

* **Salary Sheet Display:**  Uses a `DashboardSS` component to display the salary information (`finalSalary` if the sheet is active, otherwise `payrollprocesses[0].salary`).

The repeated nature of the code across revisions suggests iterative debugging or minor UI adjustments rather than substantial feature additions or refactoring.  There are no substantial code changes between the timestamps.
