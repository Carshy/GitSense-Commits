# Activity Summary for 2/26/2025

## 6:06:46 AM
The log shows development on a Django application's user management system between 5:35 AM and 5:44 AM on February 26th, 2025.  The key changes center around user permissions and profile creation upon user registration.

`serviceUsers.py` (5:35 AM): This file defines a `UserPermissionService` class with a `set_user_permissions` method. This method assigns `is_superuser` and `is_staff` flags based on the user's `role` ('admin', 'moderator', or 'writer').  All roles are assigned `is_staff` as True.

`signals.py` (5:37 AM and 5:44 AM): This file uses Django signals to manage user-related actions after a user is saved.  There are four signal receivers:

* `create_user_profile`: Creates a user profile when a new user is created.
* `save_user_profile`: Saves the associated user profile.
* `assign_role_to_superuser`: Assigns the 'admin' role to newly created superusers.
* `set_user_permissions_on_save`: Calls `UserPermissionService.set_user_permissions` to set permissions based on the user's role after a user is created.

The changes between the two entries for `signals.py` (5:37 AM and 5:44 AM) are minor. The only visible difference is the import path of `UserPermissionService`, which is corrected from `./services/serviceUsers` to `users.services.serviceUsers` in the second entry, fixing a relative import issue.  The functionality remains unchanged.  The overall pattern shows a well-structured approach to user management, separating permission logic from the signal handling.
