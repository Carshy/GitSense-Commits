# Activity Summary for 2/25/2025

## 5:45:45 AM
The log shows two edits to `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/personal/tell_a_tale_spot/tell_tales/users/services.py`.  Both edits modify the `set_user_permissions` method within the `UserPermissionService` class.  The first edit (5:06:08 AM) contains a redundant `elif user.role == 'admin'` condition. The second edit (5:07:07 AM), made only a minute later, corrects this redundancy by removing the duplicate 'admin' condition.  Both versions assign `is_staff` to `True` for all roles ('admin', 'moderator', 'writer').  `is_superuser` is set to `True` only for the 'admin' role.  The changes primarily focus on fixing a logical error in the conditional logic for assigning user permissions.


## 9:16:22 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/hecqatar-admin/components/datatables/salarySheetDT.vue`, a Vue.js component responsible for displaying and exporting salary sheet data.  The primary changes revolve around data formatting and the separation of data processing for display and Excel export.

Initially (8:46:27 AM), the component rendered a data table with features like search and Excel export functionality using a `download-excel` component.  Number formatting within the table was handled by a commented-out function and inline formatting within templates. The `computeSalarySheetDOJ` method was initially incomplete or commented out.  A `checkIfHasSalaryAdjustment` method was added to highlight employees with salary changes.


Between 8:46:27 AM and 8:57:39 AM, several minor updates occurred. The most significant was the implementation of the `formattedFigures` method for precise number formatting (adding commas for thousands separators and handling null or undefined values), enhancing the accuracy and readability of numeric data in the salary sheet. A small change also occurred in the `total_salary` template, with `.toFixed(2)` being added and removed repeatedly.

At 9:04:24 AM, a crucial refactoring separated data preparation for display (`computeSalarySheetDOJ`) and Excel export (`getExcelData`). `computeSalarySheetDOJ` now simply orders the data by first name, while `getExcelData` performs necessary formatting for the excel export, handling null values explicitly. The `download-excel` component was updated to use `getExcelData` as its data source.

The final revision (9:13:49 AM) contains no further changes to the functionality; it is identical to the previous version.

Throughout the updates, the core functionality remained consistent: displaying salary data in a searchable data table and exporting it to Excel.  The improvements focused on robust data formatting, particularly for numeric values, and a cleaner separation of concerns in data handling.  The use of `lodash`'s `orderBy` for sorting is also consistent across all versions.
