# Activity Summary for 2/25/2025

## 5:45:45 AM
The log shows two edits to `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/personal/tell_a_tale_spot/tell_tales/users/services.py`.  Both edits modify the `set_user_permissions` method within the `UserPermissionService` class.  The first edit (5:06:08 AM) contains a redundant `elif user.role == 'admin'` condition. The second edit (5:07:07 AM), made only a minute later, corrects this redundancy by removing the duplicate 'admin' condition.  Both versions assign `is_staff` to `True` for all roles ('admin', 'moderator', 'writer').  `is_superuser` is set to `True` only for the 'admin' role.  The changes primarily focus on fixing a logical error in the conditional logic for assigning user permissions.
