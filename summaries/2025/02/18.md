# Activity Summary for 2/18/2025

## 6:07:46 AM
The primary change on February 18th, 2025, at 5:17:50 AM, involved the `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/personal/tell_a_tale_spot/tell_tales/tell_tales/settings.py` file.  This file, a Django settings configuration, was updated to include settings for media file handling (`MEDIA_URL`, `MEDIA_ROOT`),  and crucially, detailed configurations for REST framework authentication using `rest_framework_simplejwt`. This includes specifying JWT authentication classes, permission classes, token lifetimes (50 minutes for access, 1 day for refresh), and  CORS allowed origins (listing `http://localhost:3000` for development and a placeholder for a production frontend).  The database settings were configured for PostgreSQL, using a specified user, password, and database name.  Various Django settings related to security, templating, and password validation were also present but not explicitly modified in this log entry. The addition of `rest_framework_simplejwt` and the CORS settings strongly suggest the application is being set up for integration with a frontend application, likely a React application based on the provided localhost address.

The log shows numerous changes to environment variables within a `.env` file, primarily concerning database connection strings, API URLs, and authentication keys.  Significant changes occurred on February 18th, 2025, at 9:57:19 AM.  The changes involve updating numerous URLs and keys related to various services, including MongoDB databases (multiple instances for different environments - staging, production, development), AWS credentials (access keys, secret keys, and region), email services (SendGrid, Mailtrap), and various API endpoints.  There's a pattern of using `devnhr.com` and `nathanerp.com` domains for many of the API URLs, suggesting a consistent infrastructure setup.  The log also shows the configuration of JWT (JSON Web Token) settings, including expiration times for different token types.  Multiple DATABASE_URL entries are present, possibly reflecting different database usages or a history of changes.  Finally, several keys for external services are included (e.g., Google Translate, Microsoft OAuth) along with internal ERP login details.  The presence of both local (`localhost`) and remote URLs suggests a development environment alongside production and staging environments. The inclusion of `VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY` and `VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY` suggests the use of Web Push Notifications.
