# Activity Summary for 2/18/2025

## 6:07:46 AM
The primary change on February 18th, 2025, at 5:17:50 AM, involved the `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/personal/tell_a_tale_spot/tell_tales/tell_tales/settings.py` file.  This file, a Django settings configuration, was updated to include settings for media file handling (`MEDIA_URL`, `MEDIA_ROOT`),  and crucially, detailed configurations for REST framework authentication using `rest_framework_simplejwt`. This includes specifying JWT authentication classes, permission classes, token lifetimes (50 minutes for access, 1 day for refresh), and  CORS allowed origins (listing `http://localhost:3000` for development and a placeholder for a production frontend).  The database settings were configured for PostgreSQL, using a specified user, password, and database name.  Various Django settings related to security, templating, and password validation were also present but not explicitly modified in this log entry. The addition of `rest_framework_simplejwt` and the CORS settings strongly suggest the application is being set up for integration with a frontend application, likely a React application based on the provided localhost address.

The log shows numerous changes to environment variables within a `.env` file, primarily concerning database connection strings, API URLs, and authentication keys.  Significant changes occurred on February 18th, 2025, at 9:57:19 AM.  The changes involve updating numerous URLs and keys related to various services, including MongoDB databases (multiple instances for different environments - staging, production, development), AWS credentials (access keys, secret keys, and region), email services (SendGrid, Mailtrap), and various API endpoints.  There's a pattern of using `devnhr.com` and `nathanerp.com` domains for many of the API URLs, suggesting a consistent infrastructure setup.  The log also shows the configuration of JWT (JSON Web Token) settings, including expiration times for different token types.  Multiple DATABASE_URL entries are present, possibly reflecting different database usages or a history of changes.  Finally, several keys for external services are included (e.g., Google Translate, Microsoft OAuth) along with internal ERP login details.  The presence of both local (`localhost`) and remote URLs suggests a development environment alongside production and staging environments. The inclusion of `VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY` and `VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY` suggests the use of Web Push Notifications.


## 10:10:37 AM
The log shows three revisions of the `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/sata-admin/plugins/salary-sheet.js` file.  All revisions share the same basic structure: functions for creating workbooks, adding worksheets, and handling header configurations.  The core functionality remains consistent across all three versions.

The significant difference lies within a large commented-out `async function handleSalarySheetData`. This function, present in all three revisions, appears to be under development. It's designed to handle the main salary sheet data, including:

* **Custom and default column handling:**  It processes both custom and default columns defined in a `payrollConfig` object, seemingly allowing flexible customization of the salary sheet. Note that the "Team" column is explicitly filtered out.
* **Data formatting and styling:** Extensive formatting is applied to cells, including borders, font styles, alignment, and row heights, aiming for a visually appealing and well-structured Excel sheet.
* **Employee grouping by team:** Employees are grouped by their team (or categorized as "Uncategorized" if no team is specified) before being added to the worksheet.
* **Totals calculation:**  It calculates and displays team totals and potentially grand totals, depending on configuration options within `payrollConfig`.

The timestamps indicate that the commented-out code was present from the first revision (9:33:01 AM) and remained unchanged in subsequent revisions (9:45:16 AM and 10:06:46 AM).  This suggests that the developer may be iterating on other aspects of the plugin while leaving this core data processing function in a commented state for later implementation or review.  No changes to the working parts of the code (workbook creation, worksheet addition, header configuration) occurred during these revisions.
