# Activity Summary for 2/18/2025

## 6:07:46 AM
The primary change on February 18th, 2025, at 5:17:50 AM, involved the `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/personal/tell_a_tale_spot/tell_tales/tell_tales/settings.py` file.  This file, a Django settings configuration, was updated to include settings for media file handling (`MEDIA_URL`, `MEDIA_ROOT`),  and crucially, detailed configurations for REST framework authentication using `rest_framework_simplejwt`. This includes specifying JWT authentication classes, permission classes, token lifetimes (50 minutes for access, 1 day for refresh), and  CORS allowed origins (listing `http://localhost:3000` for development and a placeholder for a production frontend).  The database settings were configured for PostgreSQL, using a specified user, password, and database name.  Various Django settings related to security, templating, and password validation were also present but not explicitly modified in this log entry. The addition of `rest_framework_simplejwt` and the CORS settings strongly suggest the application is being set up for integration with a frontend application, likely a React application based on the provided localhost address.
