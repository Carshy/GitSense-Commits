# Activity Summary for 2/18/2025

## 6:07:46 AM
The primary change on February 18th, 2025, at 5:17:50 AM, involved the `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/personal/tell_a_tale_spot/tell_tales/tell_tales/settings.py` file.  This file, a Django settings configuration, was updated to include settings for media file handling (`MEDIA_URL`, `MEDIA_ROOT`),  and crucially, detailed configurations for REST framework authentication using `rest_framework_simplejwt`. This includes specifying JWT authentication classes, permission classes, token lifetimes (50 minutes for access, 1 day for refresh), and  CORS allowed origins (listing `http://localhost:3000` for development and a placeholder for a production frontend).  The database settings were configured for PostgreSQL, using a specified user, password, and database name.  Various Django settings related to security, templating, and password validation were also present but not explicitly modified in this log entry. The addition of `rest_framework_simplejwt` and the CORS settings strongly suggest the application is being set up for integration with a frontend application, likely a React application based on the provided localhost address.


## 10:09:50 AM
The log shows numerous changes to environment variables within a `.env` file, primarily concerning database connection strings, API URLs, and authentication keys.  Significant changes occurred on February 18th, 2025, at 9:57:19 AM.  The changes involve updating numerous URLs and keys related to various services, including MongoDB databases (multiple instances for different environments - staging, production, development), AWS credentials (access keys, secret keys, and region), email services (SendGrid, Mailtrap), and various API endpoints.  There's a pattern of using `devnhr.com` and `nathanerp.com` domains for many of the API URLs, suggesting a consistent infrastructure setup.  The log also shows the configuration of JWT (JSON Web Token) settings, including expiration times for different token types.  Multiple DATABASE_URL entries are present, possibly reflecting different database usages or a history of changes.  Finally, several keys for external services are included (e.g., Google Translate, Microsoft OAuth) along with internal ERP login details.  The presence of both local (`localhost`) and remote URLs suggests a development environment alongside production and staging environments. The inclusion of `VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY` and `VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY` suggests the use of Web Push Notifications.


## 10:10:37 AM
The log shows three revisions of the `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/sata-admin/plugins/salary-sheet.js` file.  All revisions share the same basic structure: functions for creating workbooks, adding worksheets, and handling header configurations.  The core functionality remains consistent across all three versions.

The significant difference lies within a large commented-out `async function handleSalarySheetData`. This function, present in all three revisions, appears to be under development. It's designed to handle the main salary sheet data, including:

* **Custom and default column handling:**  It processes both custom and default columns defined in a `payrollConfig` object, seemingly allowing flexible customization of the salary sheet. Note that the "Team" column is explicitly filtered out.
* **Data formatting and styling:** Extensive formatting is applied to cells, including borders, font styles, alignment, and row heights, aiming for a visually appealing and well-structured Excel sheet.
* **Employee grouping by team:** Employees are grouped by their team (or categorized as "Uncategorized" if no team is specified) before being added to the worksheet.
* **Totals calculation:**  It calculates and displays team totals and potentially grand totals, depending on configuration options within `payrollConfig`.

The timestamps indicate that the commented-out code was present from the first revision (9:33:01 AM) and remained unchanged in subsequent revisions (9:45:16 AM and 10:06:46 AM).  This suggests that the developer may be iterating on other aspects of the plugin while leaving this core data processing function in a commented state for later implementation or review.  No changes to the working parts of the code (workbook creation, worksheet addition, header configuration) occurred during these revisions.


## 11:10:38 AM
The log shows multiple revisions of the `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/sata-admin/plugins/salary-sheet.js` file between 10:13 AM and 10:52 AM on February 18, 2025.  The core functionality remains consistent throughout all revisions:  generating a salary sheet using the `exceljs` and `moment` libraries.  The significant change is the consistent presence of a large, commented-out `async function handleSalarySheetData`. This function appears to be the main data processing and worksheet population function, but it is commented out in every revision.  The function includes extensive logic for handling custom columns, default columns, team grouping of employees, adding totals rows, and applying various cell styles (fonts, alignments, borders). The presence of this large commented-out block suggests a work-in-progress or a temporarily disabled feature.

The `handleHeaderConfig` function consistently handles the configuration and addition of header elements (company logo, company name, and pay month) to the salary sheet.  Minor changes to the header configuration are observed but don't affect the overall functionality.  All revisions maintain the same basic structure of the file.  No functional changes are observed in the committed code; the commented-out block remains unchanged in all revisions.


## 12:10:37 PM
The `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/sata-admin/plugins/salary-sheet.js` file was updated on 2/18/2025, 12:06:24 PM.  The update primarily focuses on generating an Excel salary sheet using the `exceljs` library.  The code includes functions to create workbooks and worksheets, add headers (optionally including a company logo and name, and the pay month), and  a commented-out section that was likely intended to handle the population of salary data into the sheet.  This commented-out section shows a sophisticated approach to handling salary data, including grouping employees by team, summing values for totals, and applying various cell styles (fonts, alignment, borders).  The header handling function dynamically adjusts based on configuration options.  The commented-out data processing section is notably comprehensive, dealing with custom and default columns, handling totals rows, and applying formatting to headers and data rows.  The commented-out code suggests future functionality to include team-based grouping and totaling of salary data within the generated spreadsheet. The  `moment` library is used for date formatting and a base64 encoded company logo is incorporated into the header.


## 3:24:24 PM
The log shows three updates to `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/payfuture-hrms-admin/pages/payroll/_id.vue` on February 18th, 2025.  All three updates involve the same file and contain very similar code, suggesting minor iterative changes.  The primary focus of the code is a Vue.js component rendering a payroll data table.  This table displays payroll processes, allowing various actions depending on the status ('active', 'inactive') and type ('Monthly', 'Supplementary') of each payroll run.

The changes primarily center around the `v-slot:item.actions` section within the `v-data-table`.  This section defines the actions available for each row in the table, including:

* **Adding new pay items:** Using `AddNewPayitem` and `AddNewPayitemOffCycle` components.
* **Approval requests:** Showing notifications and handling approval/rejection via dialogs (`ApprovalDialogOffCycle`).
* **Withholding salary:** A functionality to withhold employee salaries.
* **Submitting for approval:**  A button to submit the payroll for approval.
* **Downloading SIF files:**  Allows downloading files related to each payroll run.
* **Viewing logs and comments:** Provides access to logs and comment sections associated with each run.
* **Closing payroll sheets:**  Buttons for closing off-cycle and monthly payroll sheets.
* **Editing supplementary payroll sheets:**  Provides edit functionality for supplementary payroll.

The timestamps indicate rapid iteration between 2:33:09 PM, 2:33:53 PM, and 3:00:01 PM. The only noticeable difference between the revisions appears to be a minor text change in the tooltip for approval requests:  "My Approvals Requests" in the second revision changes back to "Approvals Requests" in the third.  The overall structure and functionality of the code remain consistent across all three revisions.
