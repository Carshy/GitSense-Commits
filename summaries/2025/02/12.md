# Activity Summary for 2/12/2025

## 10:51:29 AM
The log shows three consecutive updates to the `.env` file within a 29-second period on February 12, 2025.  The changes primarily involve the `DATABASE_URL` variable.  Initially, multiple commented-out `DATABASE_URL` options are present, and one active entry.  In the second update, another `DATABASE_URL`  is added, making two active. In the final update, one of the two active DATABASE_URL entries is commented out, leaving one active entry.  The rest of the environment variables remain largely consistent across all three updates, suggesting a focus on database configuration changes.  There is no pattern of changes aside from the `DATABASE_URL` variable.
