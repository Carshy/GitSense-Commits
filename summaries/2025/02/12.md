# Activity Summary for 2/12/2025

## 10:51:29 AM
The log shows three consecutive updates to the `.env` file within a 29-second period on February 12, 2025.  The changes primarily involve the `DATABASE_URL` variable.  Initially, multiple commented-out `DATABASE_URL` options are present, and one active entry.  In the second update, another `DATABASE_URL`  is added, making two active. In the final update, one of the two active DATABASE_URL entries is commented out, leaving one active entry.  The rest of the environment variables remain largely consistent across all three updates, suggesting a focus on database configuration changes.  There is no pattern of changes aside from the `DATABASE_URL` variable.


## 10:51:56 AM
The log shows two updates to `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/payfuture-hrms-admin/pages/payroll/_id.vue`, both occurring on February 12th, 2025.  The changes are minor and do not alter the overall functionality of the component.  Both versions contain a Vue.js component rendering a payroll management interface. The component displays payroll sheets in a data table, allowing for actions like generating supplementary payrolls, submitting for approval, approving/rejecting, downloading SIF files, viewing logs, and adding new pay items (both monthly and off-cycle).  The code includes conditional rendering based on payroll status ('active', 'inactive'), approval status ('true', 'false'), and payroll type ('Monthly', 'Supplementary').  There is no substantive difference between the two code snippets. The second update (10:51:29 AM) is virtually identical to the first (10:49:34 AM), suggesting a possible accidental double save or a very minor, inconsequential edit that is not readily apparent in a diff comparison.


## 11:51:30 AM
The log shows numerous changes to environment variables within a `.env` file, primarily related to database connections, AWS credentials, and API URLs.  The timestamps are not directly linked to specific changes within the file content itself, only to when the entire file was updated as one version.


The file contains multiple commented-out database URLs, suggesting experimentation with different MongoDB instances across various environments (dev, staging, prod).  The active `DATABASE_URL` points to a `payfuture-hrms-staging` database at the time of the latest log entry.


There are several sets of AWS credentials (`SECRET_KEY_AWS`, `SECRET_ID_AWS`, `ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_REGION`),  indicating potential use of different AWS accounts or services.  `BUCKET_NAME` variables show usage of different buckets for storage.  Other significant changes involve updating URLs for various APIs (`BASE_URL`, `API_URL`, `CENTRAL_URL`, `Micro_Service_Url`, `documenturl`),  and email configuration settings, including SMTP details and sending keys (`SENDGRID_API_KEY`). The log also includes JWT configuration values and keys for authentication and authorization.  Multiple keys and URLs were updated or added, and many are commented out, implying a history of experimentation and adjustments to different environments and services.  Finally, various other environment variables related to client URLs, cookie domains, encryption keys, OAuth configurations for Microsoft single sign-on, and notification services are also present.  There are multiple entries for `OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET` and `OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` also, likely indicating changes during development related to Microsoft integration.


## 11:51:59 AM
The log shows multiple updates to `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/payfuture-hrms-admin/pages/payroll/_id.vue` between 10:53 AM and 11:39 AM on February 12, 2025.  The code remains largely unchanged across these revisions; there are no substantive differences in functionality. The changes appear to be minor formatting adjustments or very small edits within the existing code.


A separate component, `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/payfuture-hrms-admin/components/datatables/salarySheetDT.vue`, was updated once at 11:44 AM on February 12, 2025. This update changed the title of the component from "My Salary Sheet" to "Salary Sheet".  The component displays a salary sheet and allows for exporting the data in XLSX and CSV formats. The export functionality retrieves approval data from the server via an API call to `/users/adminCentral/user/{userId}` using a Bearer token fetched from the Vuex store.  The component dynamically generates headers for the data table based on the `config` prop, including fixed fields, earnings, and deductions.  It also highlights salary adjustments with a red icon.
