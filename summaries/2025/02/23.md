# Activity Summary for 2/23/2025

## 10:05:52 AM
The log shows a single code update to `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/personal/tell_a_tale_spot/tell_tales/tale_a_tale/models.py` at 9:52:02 AM on February 23, 2025.  This update defines Django models for `Category` and `Post`. The `Category` model is simple, storing a unique category name. The `Post` model is more complex, including fields for title, author (foreign key to Django's `AUTH_USER_MODEL`), profile (foreign key to a custom `Profile` model), content, excerpt, photo, status (with choices for draft, pending, revision, approved, and published), approval information, category (foreign key to `Category`), and timestamps.  The code uses `timezone.now` for default timestamps and includes several nullable and blankable fields for flexibility.  There is no evidence of recurring elements or patterns beyond standard Django model definitions.
