# Activity Summary for 2/14/2025

## 9:53:55 AM
The log shows a series of modifications to the `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/sata-admin/plugins/salary-sheet.js` file between 9:05 AM and 9:50 AM on February 14, 2025.  The primary focus of the changes is the `handleSalarySheetData` function, which generates salary sheets using the `exceljs` library.

Initially, the `handleSalarySheetData` function was heavily commented out, suggesting it was under development.  Early versions focused on iterating through salary data, grouping by columns, calculating totals, and applying cell styling (borders, fonts, alignment).  These iterations involved a significant amount of commented-out code related to column management, group headers, totals, and data formatting.  There is a commented-out attempt to display salary data and identify available keys within the salary entries.

The most significant changes occurred between 9:34 AM and 9:50 AM.  During this period, the developer implemented a new section for handling "Team" headers.  The commented-out `handleSalarySheetData` function was replaced with a more refined version that specifically handles the "Team" column. The "Team" column is initially excluded from regular columns, and then added as a merged header row above the employee data for each team.  The team headers receive specific styling (bold font, alignment, border), and the rows are adjusted to increase height and enhance readability.  The change at 9:39 AM fine-tunes the team header styling by adding indentation.


The `handleHeaderConfig` function remained relatively stable throughout the modifications, managing the configuration of the salary sheet header (company logo, name, and pay month).  It uses `moment.js` for date formatting and consistently uses a consistent style for header cell styling. The file consistently uses `ExcelJS` for Excel file manipulation and `moment` for date handling.  The overall development pattern shows a gradual refinement of the salary sheet generation logic, moving from a commented-out, comprehensive initial version to a more modular approach that cleanly handles team headers.
