# Activity Summary for 2/27/2025

## 8:01:51 AM
The log shows multiple revisions of the `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/sata-admin/plugins/salary-sheet.js` file between 7:43 AM and 7:57 AM on February 27, 2025.  The core functionality remains consistent: generating salary sheets using ExcelJS.  The changes primarily focus on the `handleSalarySheetData` function.


The earliest version (7:43 AM)  includes basic salary sheet generation with header and footer configuration.  Subsequent updates (7:48 AM and 7:48:52 AM) add a new `iban` property to each salary entry within the `payrollProcess.salary` array and logs each `iban` number.  A minor change in the log statement is observed between the two timestamps. The final version at 7:57:27 AM shows a further modification within the loop where `sal.iban` is assigned and then immediately returned without a clear purpose.  The rest of the code in `handleSalarySheetData` manages data grouping by team, calculating totals, adding headers, formatting cells and generating a grand total row if configured to do so.

The `handleHeaderConfig` function manages the addition of a company logo, company name, and pay month to the salary sheet header, based on configuration options. The `handleFooter` function, which was incomplete in all revisions included in the log, deals with adding approver information to the footer.

The consistent use of `payrollConfig` and `payrollProcess` objects throughout the code suggests a structured approach to configuring and processing salary data.  The frequent modifications to the `handleSalarySheetData` function indicate iterative development and debugging, particularly around handling and displaying IBAN numbers.  The incomplete `handleFooter` function suggests ongoing development in that area.


## 9:01:50 AM
The log shows multiple revisions of `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/sata-admin/plugins/salary-sheet.js` on February 27, 2025.  The file is a JavaScript plugin for generating salary sheets using the `exceljs` and `moment` libraries.

The core functionality remains consistent across all revisions.  The code includes functions to:

*   Create an Excel workbook (`createWorkBook`).
*   Add worksheets to the workbook (`addWorkSheet`).
*   Configure the header of the salary sheet based on `payrollConfig` (e.g., including company logo, name, and pay month) (`handleHeaderConfig`).

A large, commented-out `async function handleSalarySheetData` is present in all revisions.  This function appears to be designed to handle the population of the salary sheet with employee data, including grouping by team, calculating totals, and formatting cells.  The commented-out state suggests this function is under development or temporarily disabled.  The comments within this function indicate intentions to display payroll data, including IBAN numbers, and to manage custom and default columns in the salary sheet,  potentially also adding totals rows and handling grand totals.

There are no substantive changes to the code between the revisions; the commented-out `handleSalarySheetData` function remains unchanged.  The timestamps indicate a series of quick edits or possibly debugging sessions within a short time frame (approximately 30 minutes).


## 11:24:49 AM
The Nuxt.js configuration file (`nuxt.config.js`) was updated on February 27, 2025, at 10:41:53 AM.  Key changes include updates to environment variables (`env`),  plugins, and security settings.

**File-Specific Updates:**

* **Environment Variables (`env`):**  The environment variables were updated to include `documenturl` and `insurancePortalUrl`, pointing to specific URLs. The `NODE_ENV` variable is set based on the `process.env.NODE_ENV` value, defaulting to "development".
* **Plugins:** Several plugins were added or modified, including those for  `vue-awesome-swiper`, various chart libraries (`chartjs`, `apexcharts`),  `vue-excel`, `quillEditorjs`, Google Maps, and a  vue organization chart. The plugins are selectively enabled on the client-side or server-side using `ssr` and `mode` properties.  Importantly, some plugins (`quillEditorjs`, `chartjs`, `googleMaps`, `vue-organization-chart`, `vue-tree-chart`) are explicitly set to `ssr: false`, meaning they are only loaded on the client-side.
* **Security (`helmet`, `csp`):** The `helmet` module was configured with various security headers (e.g., `frameguard`, `xssFilter`, `hsts`).  A Content Security Policy (CSP) was also implemented within the `router` configuration to restrict resources that the application is allowed to load.
* **Axios Configuration:** The `axios` module was configured with a dynamic `baseURL`, `crossDomain`, and `https` properties depending on the environment setting (`config[appEnv]`).
* **Authentication (`auth`):**  An authentication strategy (`local`) was set up using  `auth-next` module with refresh token functionality.
* **Internationalization (`i18n`):**  The `i18n` module was configured to support English and Arabic.
* **Webpack Configuration:** A webpack plugin was added to provide global variables like lodash and Quill.js.  The `devtool` is set to `false` in development mode.
* **Vuetify Configuration:**  The Vuetify theme was customized with a primary color and other theme settings.


**Significant Changes Timestamp:** February 27, 2025, 10:41:53 AM (This reflects the timestamp of the entire configuration update.)

**Recurring Elements:**  Several client-side plugins are used for different UI components and visualization, reflecting a rich front-end interface.  There's a clear focus on security through  CSP and Helmet headers configuration.  The use of dynamic configuration based on the environment (`appEnv`) ensures adaptability across different deployment environments.
