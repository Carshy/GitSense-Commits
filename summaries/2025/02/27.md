# Activity Summary for 2/27/2025

## 8:01:51 AM
The log shows multiple revisions of the `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/sata-admin/plugins/salary-sheet.js` file between 7:43 AM and 7:57 AM on February 27, 2025.  The core functionality remains consistent: generating salary sheets using ExcelJS.  The changes primarily focus on the `handleSalarySheetData` function.


The earliest version (7:43 AM)  includes basic salary sheet generation with header and footer configuration.  Subsequent updates (7:48 AM and 7:48:52 AM) add a new `iban` property to each salary entry within the `payrollProcess.salary` array and logs each `iban` number.  A minor change in the log statement is observed between the two timestamps. The final version at 7:57:27 AM shows a further modification within the loop where `sal.iban` is assigned and then immediately returned without a clear purpose.  The rest of the code in `handleSalarySheetData` manages data grouping by team, calculating totals, adding headers, formatting cells and generating a grand total row if configured to do so.

The `handleHeaderConfig` function manages the addition of a company logo, company name, and pay month to the salary sheet header, based on configuration options. The `handleFooter` function, which was incomplete in all revisions included in the log, deals with adding approver information to the footer.

The consistent use of `payrollConfig` and `payrollProcess` objects throughout the code suggests a structured approach to configuring and processing salary data.  The frequent modifications to the `handleSalarySheetData` function indicate iterative development and debugging, particularly around handling and displaying IBAN numbers.  The incomplete `handleFooter` function suggests ongoing development in that area.


## 9:01:50 AM
The log shows multiple revisions of `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/sata-admin/plugins/salary-sheet.js` on February 27, 2025.  The file is a JavaScript plugin for generating salary sheets using the `exceljs` and `moment` libraries.

The core functionality remains consistent across all revisions.  The code includes functions to:

*   Create an Excel workbook (`createWorkBook`).
*   Add worksheets to the workbook (`addWorkSheet`).
*   Configure the header of the salary sheet based on `payrollConfig` (e.g., including company logo, name, and pay month) (`handleHeaderConfig`).

A large, commented-out `async function handleSalarySheetData` is present in all revisions.  This function appears to be designed to handle the population of the salary sheet with employee data, including grouping by team, calculating totals, and formatting cells.  The commented-out state suggests this function is under development or temporarily disabled.  The comments within this function indicate intentions to display payroll data, including IBAN numbers, and to manage custom and default columns in the salary sheet,  potentially also adding totals rows and handling grand totals.

There are no substantive changes to the code between the revisions; the commented-out `handleSalarySheetData` function remains unchanged.  The timestamps indicate a series of quick edits or possibly debugging sessions within a short time frame (approximately 30 minutes).


## 11:24:49 AM
The Nuxt.js configuration file (`nuxt.config.js`) was updated on February 27, 2025, at 10:41:53 AM.  Key changes include updates to environment variables (`env`),  plugins, and security settings.

**File-Specific Updates:**

* **Environment Variables (`env`):**  The environment variables were updated to include `documenturl` and `insurancePortalUrl`, pointing to specific URLs. The `NODE_ENV` variable is set based on the `process.env.NODE_ENV` value, defaulting to "development".
* **Plugins:** Several plugins were added or modified, including those for  `vue-awesome-swiper`, various chart libraries (`chartjs`, `apexcharts`),  `vue-excel`, `quillEditorjs`, Google Maps, and a  vue organization chart. The plugins are selectively enabled on the client-side or server-side using `ssr` and `mode` properties.  Importantly, some plugins (`quillEditorjs`, `chartjs`, `googleMaps`, `vue-organization-chart`, `vue-tree-chart`) are explicitly set to `ssr: false`, meaning they are only loaded on the client-side.
* **Security (`helmet`, `csp`):** The `helmet` module was configured with various security headers (e.g., `frameguard`, `xssFilter`, `hsts`).  A Content Security Policy (CSP) was also implemented within the `router` configuration to restrict resources that the application is allowed to load.
* **Axios Configuration:** The `axios` module was configured with a dynamic `baseURL`, `crossDomain`, and `https` properties depending on the environment setting (`config[appEnv]`).
* **Authentication (`auth`):**  An authentication strategy (`local`) was set up using  `auth-next` module with refresh token functionality.
* **Internationalization (`i18n`):**  The `i18n` module was configured to support English and Arabic.
* **Webpack Configuration:** A webpack plugin was added to provide global variables like lodash and Quill.js.  The `devtool` is set to `false` in development mode.
* **Vuetify Configuration:**  The Vuetify theme was customized with a primary color and other theme settings.


**Significant Changes Timestamp:** February 27, 2025, 10:41:53 AM (This reflects the timestamp of the entire configuration update.)

**Recurring Elements:**  Several client-side plugins are used for different UI components and visualization, reflecting a rich front-end interface.  There's a clear focus on security through  CSP and Helmet headers configuration.  The use of dynamic configuration based on the environment (`appEnv`) ensures adaptability across different deployment environments.


## 3:06:22 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/hecqatar-admin/components/datatables/payItemDT.vue` and one revision to `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/hecqatar-admin/components/datatables/salarySheetDT.vue` between 2:17 PM and 2:52 PM on February 27, 2025.

The `payItemDT.vue` file underwent significant changes focused primarily on the formatting of the `amount` field within a Vue.js data table.  Initially, the amount was formatted using a custom filter (`amountFormatter`).  This was then replaced with a `formattedFigures` method which adds commas as thousands separators to numbers with four or more digits and keeps two decimal places.  After several revisions, the `amountFormatter` filter was restored.


The changes in `payItemDT.vue`  also involved refactoring.  The `getExcelData` computed property, initially within both the `computed` and `methods` sections, was eventually simplified and placed solely within `computed`. The code for this method consistently handles formatting numeric data for Excel export, excluding specific fields.  The `excludeFields` array shows the fields consistently excluded from numeric formatting.

The `salarySheetDT.vue` file, updated once at 2:43 PM, introduces a data table displaying salary information. It includes functionality to download data as an Excel sheet using a custom component (`download-excel`).  The component dynamically generates headers based on the `config` prop, differentiating between fixed, earning, and deduction fields.  The amount fields also get formatted using the `formattedFigures` method.  A tooltip is displayed if a salary adjustment exists for an employee.


Throughout the `payItemDT.vue` revisions, the core functionality remained the same: displaying a data table of pay items with various formatting and actions (view).  The primary changes were focused on optimizing the amount formatting and refactoring the code for better organization and readability.


## 4:06:28 PM
The log shows numerous revisions to `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/hecqatar-admin/pages/payitems/index.vue` between 3:09 PM and 4:02 PM on February 27, 2025.  The main focus of these changes appears to be refining the UI for displaying pay items and recurring items.  A  `download-excel` component is used for exporting data to excel sheets.

Initially, the component rendered differently based on `selectPayitems` (a boolean indicating whether to display "Pay Items" or "Recurring Items"). Both sections included:

*   An `AddNewPayitem` component for adding new items.
*   A `download-excel` component to export data to an Excel file.  The data and fields used differ between the sections.
*   Company and month selectors using `v-autocomplete` and `v-select` respectively.
*   A search filter (`v-text-field`).
*   A `v-data-table` to display the items, with custom slots for formatting data and displaying actions (edit and view logs).

Between the first and last commits, there were several minor changes in the code. The most notable change involved the addition of  `props: ['itemP']` in the `<script>` section.  There were also small structural changes within the `v-col` elements, and a brief removal and re-addition of the `download-excel` component in one of the `v-col` sections in the Pay Items section.  The core functionality and structure remained largely consistent throughout the revisions.  The final version of the file has a `download-excel` component present in the Pay Items section.

A separate file, `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/hecqatar-admin/components/datatables/salarySheetDT.vue`, was also updated at 3:58:55 PM on the same day. This component is a data table for displaying a salary sheet, featuring a `download-excel` component for export. This component includes functionality to dynamically generate headers based on configuration data and conditionally format the numerical values. It also includes a tooltip indicating salary adjustments for individual employees.
