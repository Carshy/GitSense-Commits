# Activity Summary for 2/27/2025

## 8:01:51 AM
The log shows multiple revisions of the `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/sata-admin/plugins/salary-sheet.js` file between 7:43 AM and 7:57 AM on February 27, 2025.  The core functionality remains consistent: generating salary sheets using ExcelJS.  The changes primarily focus on the `handleSalarySheetData` function.


The earliest version (7:43 AM)  includes basic salary sheet generation with header and footer configuration.  Subsequent updates (7:48 AM and 7:48:52 AM) add a new `iban` property to each salary entry within the `payrollProcess.salary` array and logs each `iban` number.  A minor change in the log statement is observed between the two timestamps. The final version at 7:57:27 AM shows a further modification within the loop where `sal.iban` is assigned and then immediately returned without a clear purpose.  The rest of the code in `handleSalarySheetData` manages data grouping by team, calculating totals, adding headers, formatting cells and generating a grand total row if configured to do so.

The `handleHeaderConfig` function manages the addition of a company logo, company name, and pay month to the salary sheet header, based on configuration options. The `handleFooter` function, which was incomplete in all revisions included in the log, deals with adding approver information to the footer.

The consistent use of `payrollConfig` and `payrollProcess` objects throughout the code suggests a structured approach to configuring and processing salary data.  The frequent modifications to the `handleSalarySheetData` function indicate iterative development and debugging, particularly around handling and displaying IBAN numbers.  The incomplete `handleFooter` function suggests ongoing development in that area.


## 9:01:50 AM
The log shows multiple revisions of `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/sata-admin/plugins/salary-sheet.js` on February 27, 2025.  The file is a JavaScript plugin for generating salary sheets using the `exceljs` and `moment` libraries.

The core functionality remains consistent across all revisions.  The code includes functions to:

*   Create an Excel workbook (`createWorkBook`).
*   Add worksheets to the workbook (`addWorkSheet`).
*   Configure the header of the salary sheet based on `payrollConfig` (e.g., including company logo, name, and pay month) (`handleHeaderConfig`).

A large, commented-out `async function handleSalarySheetData` is present in all revisions.  This function appears to be designed to handle the population of the salary sheet with employee data, including grouping by team, calculating totals, and formatting cells.  The commented-out state suggests this function is under development or temporarily disabled.  The comments within this function indicate intentions to display payroll data, including IBAN numbers, and to manage custom and default columns in the salary sheet,  potentially also adding totals rows and handling grand totals.

There are no substantive changes to the code between the revisions; the commented-out `handleSalarySheetData` function remains unchanged.  The timestamps indicate a series of quick edits or possibly debugging sessions within a short time frame (approximately 30 minutes).
