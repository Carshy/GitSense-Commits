# Activity Summary for 2/27/2025

## 8:01:51 AM
The log shows multiple revisions of the `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/sata-admin/plugins/salary-sheet.js` file between 7:43 AM and 7:57 AM on February 27, 2025.  The core functionality remains consistent: generating salary sheets using ExcelJS.  The changes primarily focus on the `handleSalarySheetData` function.


The earliest version (7:43 AM)  includes basic salary sheet generation with header and footer configuration.  Subsequent updates (7:48 AM and 7:48:52 AM) add a new `iban` property to each salary entry within the `payrollProcess.salary` array and logs each `iban` number.  A minor change in the log statement is observed between the two timestamps. The final version at 7:57:27 AM shows a further modification within the loop where `sal.iban` is assigned and then immediately returned without a clear purpose.  The rest of the code in `handleSalarySheetData` manages data grouping by team, calculating totals, adding headers, formatting cells and generating a grand total row if configured to do so.

The `handleHeaderConfig` function manages the addition of a company logo, company name, and pay month to the salary sheet header, based on configuration options. The `handleFooter` function, which was incomplete in all revisions included in the log, deals with adding approver information to the footer.

The consistent use of `payrollConfig` and `payrollProcess` objects throughout the code suggests a structured approach to configuring and processing salary data.  The frequent modifications to the `handleSalarySheetData` function indicate iterative development and debugging, particularly around handling and displaying IBAN numbers.  The incomplete `handleFooter` function suggests ongoing development in that area.
