# Activity Summary for 2/10/2025

## 2:29:50 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of a `.env` file between 1:32 PM and 1:34 PM on February 10, 2025.  The primary focus of the changes appears to be around the `DATABASE_URL` variable. Initially, multiple commented-out `DATABASE_URL` options exist, with one active connection string.  Subsequent revisions attempt to format this variable in JSON-like syntax ("DATABASE_URL": "..."), but ultimately revert to a standard key-value pair format.  The final revision removes one of the commented-out  `DATABASE_URL` entries.  No other significant changes are observed across the other variables within the `.env` file during this period.  The other variables remain consistent across all revisions, including various API URLs, keys, and database connection strings for different services (e.g., SendGrid, AWS, MongoDB).
