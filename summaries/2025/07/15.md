# Activity Summary for 7/15/2025

## 6:03:31 PM
The log shows multiple edits to the `Elegance-Choice` project on July 15, 2025.  The `.env` file underwent several minor revisions between 1:12 PM and 1:13 PM, all setting the `NUXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE` environment variable to `https://fakestoreapi.com`.  These changes appear inconsequential as the value remained consistent.

More substantial changes occurred in the `pages` directory between 3:07 PM and 3:09 PM.  A `products.vue` file was created, containing a basic template displaying a `ProductGrid` component.  The `index.vue` file saw several iterations: initially empty, then briefly displaying only a `div`, and finally settling on a template displaying "Welcome to Home Page".  All `.vue` files use `<script setup lang="ts"> </script>`, indicating the use of TypeScript.
