# Activity Summary for 7/3/2025

## 12:01:11 PM
The log shows focused development on the `products.ts` store file within the `Elegance-Choice` project, primarily between 11:08 AM and 11:56 AM on July 3rd, 2025.  Initial commits involved importing the `defineStore` function from 'pinia', gradually adding  `Product`, `ProductsState`, and `ProductFilters` types. There was some trial and error in specifying the import path for these types, eventually settling on `'@/types/product'`.  The `tsconfig.json` file was updated at 11:55 AM, likely to support the new type imports. Finally, an `api.ts` file was added at 11:58 AM, containing a fully-fledged `ApiClient` class using axios for making API requests, including request and response interceptors for error handling and potentially future authentication.  The `ApiClient` uses runtime config for the API base URL and includes methods for GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests.


## 2:14:29 PM
The log shows a series of code changes across two files: `api.ts` and `products.ts`.

**`api.ts` Changes:**

The `api.ts` file underwent minor modifications between 12:02:26 PM and 12:02:57 PM.  These changes primarily involved correcting the import statement for `useRuntimeConfig`, adding the necessary import `from 'nuxt/app'`. The core functionality of the `ApiClient` class, which handles HTTP requests using axios, remained unchanged.  The class provides methods for GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests, includes request and response interceptors for error handling and potential future authentication, and uses a singleton pattern for instantiation.

**`products.ts` Changes:**

The `products.ts` file, containing a Pinia store for managing product data, shows substantial evolution between 12:05:10 PM and 2:06:12 PM.  The initial commits involved defining the Pinia store (`useProductStore`) and incrementally building its `state` object.  The `state` was progressively enhanced to include `products`, `categories`, `loading`, `error`, `selectedCategory`, and `searchQuery` properties.  Between 12:14:08 PM and 12:19:07 PM, the `getters` object was added, defining methods for filtering products by category and search query, getting a product by ID, and getting products by category.  Finally,  between 12:24:26 PM and 2:06:12 PM, the `actions` object was added, including methods for fetching products (all and individual), fetching categories, setting filter parameters (`selectedCategory`, `searchQuery`), clearing filters, and sorting products.  There were numerous intermediate commits during the development of the actions and getters, with several commits reflecting minor syntax corrections and refactoring (e.g., correcting typos, removing/adding curly braces, switching to `type` imports in 12:30:09 PM).  The final version represents a fully functional Pinia store for managing product data with extensive filtering and sorting capabilities.  The most significant change happened around 12:18:17 PM, when the `getters` section was fully implemented, followed by the addition of the `actions` section  around 12:24:26 PM.  The final cleanup and refactoring was done in several small commits between 2 PM and 2:06:12 PM.
