# Activity Summary for 7/3/2025

## 12:01:11 PM
The log shows focused development on the `products.ts` store file within the `Elegance-Choice` project, primarily between 11:08 AM and 11:56 AM on July 3rd, 2025.  Initial commits involved importing the `defineStore` function from 'pinia', gradually adding  `Product`, `ProductsState`, and `ProductFilters` types. There was some trial and error in specifying the import path for these types, eventually settling on `'@/types/product'`.  The `tsconfig.json` file was updated at 11:55 AM, likely to support the new type imports. Finally, an `api.ts` file was added at 11:58 AM, containing a fully-fledged `ApiClient` class using axios for making API requests, including request and response interceptors for error handling and potentially future authentication.  The `ApiClient` uses runtime config for the API base URL and includes methods for GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests.
