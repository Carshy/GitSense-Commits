# Activity Summary for 7/18/2025

## 11:00:35 AM
The log shows modifications to type definitions within the `tell_media_admin` project, specifically focusing on `auth` related types.  The `auth.ts` file underwent several revisions between 10:29:27 AM and 10:29:47 AM, primarily concerning the `User` interface.  The key change here was the definition of the `role` property within the `User` interface; it was initially missing, then added as type `any`, and finally solidified as type `string`.  These changes happened within a very short time frame.

The `index.ts` file, also containing type definitions, was modified multiple times between 10:30:46 AM and 10:31:45 AM. These modifications focused on expanding the `User` interface to include `first_name` and `last_name` properties.  There was also a brief period where the `role` property was partially defined.  The final version of the `User` interface in `index.ts` aligns with the final version in `auth.ts`,  including `id`, `username`, `email`, `first_name`, `last_name`, and `role` (all strings except `id`, which is a number).  The `AuthState` and `RootState` interfaces remained largely consistent throughout these changes, serving as containers for user authentication information.  The modifications show a clear iterative process of refining the data structures.
