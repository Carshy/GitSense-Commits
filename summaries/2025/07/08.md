# Activity Summary for 7/8/2025

## 3:00:27 PM
The log shows a series of edits to the `c:\projects\Elegance-Choice\stores\products.ts` file between 2:42 PM and 2:54 PM on July 8, 2025.  The main focus of the changes is the implementation of a `filterredProducts` getter within a Pinia store.

Initially, the `products.ts` file contained a commented-out `filteredProducts` getter that performed filtering based on category and search query.  The comments were removed  and a new `filterredProducts` getter was added. The development of this getter involved several incremental commits.  Early versions were incomplete, with only the initial setup of the function present.  The code was progressively refined between 2:44 PM and 2:54 PM, adding the filtering logic for the `selectedCategory`  and then the `searchQuery`.  The final version at 2:54 PM is a complete implementation that filters products based on both category and search query, using `toLocaleLowerCase()` for case-insensitive matching.  At the same time, the older `filteredProducts` getter was removed completely.  The actions remained largely unchanged throughout, handling product and category fetching from an API.  The commented out sections also suggest an iterative approach to development, with testing and refinement before committing the final changes.
