# Activity Summary for 7/1/2025

## 1:15:54 PM
The log shows multiple edits to `c:\projects\Elegance-Choice\app.vue` on July 1st, 2025, between 12:40 PM and 12:46 PM.  The file is a Vue component template.  The primary changes involve modifications to the content within the `<div>` tag.  Initially, the component included a `<NuxtRouteAnnouncer />` component and an `<h1>` tag.  These elements were subsequently removed in stages, with the `<h1>` tag being re-added and its content modified multiple times to reflect different versions of a welcome message ("Welcom to N", then "Welcom to Nuxt 3 Collins").  The changes suggest iterative development of the welcome message within the component.


## 2:15:55 PM
The log shows modifications to the `nuxt.config.ts` and `main.css` files within the `Elegance-Choice` project on July 1st, 2025.

The `nuxt.config.ts` file underwent multiple revisions.  Initially (1:21:46 PM), it included `'~/assets/css/main.css'` in the `css` array.  This was then removed (2:07:58 PM),  only to be re-added (2:12:19 PM), but this time without the tilde (`~`)  prefix, suggesting a potential adjustment to the path resolution.  The rest of the `nuxt.config.ts` file remained consistent throughout these changes, specifying Nuxt modules (`@nuxtjs/tailwindcss`, `@pinia/nuxt`, `@vueuse/nuxt`), TypeScript configuration, the API base URL (`https://fakestoreapi.com`), and application metadata.

Meanwhile, the `main.css` file (2:11:37 PM) contains Tailwind CSS directives and custom styles for buttons (`.btn-primary`, `.btn-secondary`) and cards (`.card`).  This suggests that the project utilizes Tailwind CSS for styling.  The changes to `main.css` directly correspond to the additions and removals of the CSS file path in `nuxt.config.ts`.
