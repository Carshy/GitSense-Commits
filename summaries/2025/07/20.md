# Activity Summary for 7/20/2025

## 4:10:11 AM
The log shows development of a React application.  Initial commits (around 3:12 AM - 3:21 AM) establish the basic application structure, defining components (`App.tsx`, `Header.tsx`, `HeroSection.tsx`, `TagSection.tsx`, `SearchInput.tsx`), their associated types (`components.ts`),  and constants (`constants.ts`).  The `useSearchState` hook manages search functionality.  The application uses a dark theme (`bg-black`, `text-white`).

Between 3:25 AM and 3:27 AM, the `tsconfig.json` file was updated to specify `lib`, `module`, and `target` compiler options, suggesting adjustments to the project's build configuration.  Around 3:36 AM to 3:40 AM, more UI components are added with styling  and basic functionality.

The most significant changes occur between 3:45 AM and 3:56 AM.  The index files for the components and hooks are refined. The import paths are adjusted multiple times until a consistent and correctly structured project organization is reached. There are many small changes in this period, all related to correcting import paths to maintain consistency in the modular project structure.

Finally, between 3:57 AM and 4:09 AM, adjustments are made to the `App.tsx` file, streamlining imports and removing the unused `searchValue` state variable. The `MOCK_TAGS` constant is also adjusted and  the import paths of some components are corrected. Changes in `types/components.ts` refine the `tags` property in `TagSectionProps` to `readonly string[]`.  The final commit around 4:09 AM  is a relatively minor change showing the removal of the unnecessary `searchValue` state from the main App component.
