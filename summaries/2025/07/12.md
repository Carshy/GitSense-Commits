# Activity Summary for 7/12/2025

## 12:38:09 PM
The log shows a series of modifications to the `nuxt.config.ts` and `main.css` files within the `Elegance-Choice` project.  The majority of changes center around `nuxt.config.ts`, reflecting iterative development of the Nuxt 3 application.

Initially (12:02 PM and 12:03 PM), `nuxt.config.ts` is configured with  `@nuxtjs/tailwindcss`, `@pinia/nuxt`, and `@vueuse/nuxt` modules, TypeScript type checking, and basic meta information for an e-commerce store.  A minor, seemingly inconsequential edit occurred between these two timestamps.

At 12:05 PM, `main.css` is created, containing basic Tailwind CSS directives.  This is then emptied at 12:06 PM.

Further edits to `nuxt.config.ts` at 12:07 PM involved importing `defineNuxtConfig`. This suggests a refactoring or updating to use the correct import statement.


A significant change happens at 12:14 PM where Vite configuration is added to handle FormData, including the `axios` dependency in `optimizeDeps`.  This is followed by almost identical commit at 12:14:25 PM (likely an accidental duplicate).

The final major changes at 12:21 PM introduce `nitro` configuration for WebAssembly support (`experimental: { wasm: true }`) and updates the `vite` configuration to include `form-data` in `optimizeDeps` instead of `axios`, while removing the redundant `vite` block from earlier in the file. A final almost identical commit (likely an accidental duplicate) follows at 12:21:23 PM.

Finally, a `vite.config.js` file is added at 12:28 PM, seemingly for Vitest test configuration.

In summary: the development process involved setting up the Nuxt 3 project, configuring Tailwind CSS, adding state management and utility libraries, and integrating Vite for optimized development. The later changes focus heavily on optimizing build processes, particularly to support FormData and WebAssembly.  There is evidence of minor accidental duplicate commits.
