# Activity Summary for 8/6/2025

## 4:54:51 AM
The log shows the iterative development of a simple HTTP server in Node.js.  The primary file modified is `server.js`.

Initially, the file contained only a comment.  Between 4:06 AM and 4:11 AM, the core server functionality was built,  involving:

* Importing the `http` module.
* Creating an HTTP server using `http.createServer`.
* Setting up the response using `res.writeHead` with a 200 status code and `text/plain` content type.
*  Adding a `server.listen` function to start the server on port 3000, with a console log confirming the server is listening.  This step involved several incremental edits to complete the console log message.

There was a period of interruption around 4:11 AM to 4:12 AM, then further edits to `server.js` between 4:12 AM and 4:17 AM, largely focusing on correcting the server creation (`http.createServer` takes a request handler function, not a status code). This was followed by another longer pause before additional modifications from 4:43 AM onwards.

Between 4:43 AM and 4:53 AM, significant features were added to the server:

* Basic routing was implemented using `if/else if` statements to handle different URL paths (`/`, `/about`, `/contact`).
* Different responses were defined for each route, providing specific messages.
* Error handling was introduced for unknown routes with a 403 status code and an error message.
* The final version of the code implements a complete and functional HTTP server with basic routing and error handling, listening on port 3000.

The overall pattern shows a developer progressively building the server, initially focusing on the basic structure and then adding more complex features like routing and error handling.  Many minor edits involved completing incomplete code snippets.
