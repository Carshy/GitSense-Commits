# Activity Summary for 1/29/2025

## 11:05:59 AM
The log shows two edits to `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/babilou-admin/layouts/default.vue`.  The key change between the two commits (10:49:20 AM and 10:51:26 AM on January 29, 2025) is the un-commenting of the `<Header/>` component within the template section.  The `<script>` section remained unchanged.  This suggests a simple UI update, likely adding a header component to the layout.


## 1:06:05 PM
The log shows multiple edits to `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/babilou-admin/components/shared/header_new.vue` between 12:41 PM and 1:00 PM on January 29, 2025.  The changes primarily involve the addition and modification of navigation items within a Vue.js component that renders an application header and navigation drawer.

Initially, the component contained a navigation drawer with items for "My Work," "HR Self Service" (conditionally rendered), "Team Central" (conditionally rendered), "Admin Central" (conditionally rendered), "ATS" (conditionally rendered and as an external link), "Onboarding" (conditionally rendered), "Visa Process" (conditionally rendered), "Offboarding" (conditionally rendered), "Payroll Central" (conditionally rendered), "Performance Central" (conditionally rendered), "Assets", and "Reports" (conditionally rendered).  Large commented-out sections suggest previous iterations of the navigation structure, possibly including a collapsible "Admin Central" group with sub-items.

Subsequent edits added new navigation items for "CRM," "Client Config," and "Staffing," all conditionally rendered based on the `user.accessTag` property.  A "Tools" section was also added, including items for "Support," "Settings" (conditionally rendered based on specific `user.emp_id` values), and "My Profile."

A notable change between 12:47 PM and 12:49 PM involved adjusting the styling of the navigation drawer's outer `<div>`, adding a border. The border color changed from black to brown at 12:56 PM.  The other edits were minor formatting adjustments or lacked meaningful content changes (as seen in the empty commit at 12:42:31 PM).  The overall pattern is iterative refinement of the navigation structure, adding new features and reorganizing items into categorized sections ("General" and "Tools").


## 4:25:58 PM
The log shows two nearly identical commits to the `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/cybergate-admin/package.json` file within a minute of each other (3:42:47 PM and 3:43:08 PM on January 29th, 2025).  The only difference appears to be the removal of a duplicate `devMac` script in the second commit. Both commits describe the `package.json` of the "NATHAN_ERP" project, a private Nathan HR ERP Platform. The file contains scripts for development (`dev`, `devMac`, `development`), staging, pentesting, and production environments, all using `nodemon`, `webpack`, and `cross-env` for environment variable management.  A significant number of dependencies are listed, including various Vue.js components, charting libraries, and other tools for building a web application.  The `NODE_OPTIONS` environment variable is consistently used to set the `--max_old_space_size` for Node.js, though the value varies slightly between the different scripts.
