# Activity Summary for 1/29/2025

## 11:05:59 AM
The log shows two edits to `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/babilou-admin/layouts/default.vue`.  The key change between the two commits (10:49:20 AM and 10:51:26 AM on January 29, 2025) is the un-commenting of the `<Header/>` component within the template section.  The `<script>` section remained unchanged.  This suggests a simple UI update, likely adding a header component to the layout.
