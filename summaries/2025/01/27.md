# Activity Summary for 1/27/2025

## 12:07:00 PM
The log shows three consecutive updates to `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/babilou-admin/nuxt.config.js` within a short time frame (11:26:21 AM, 11:26:37 AM, and 11:26:50 AM on January 27, 2025).  The changes are minimal and appear to be related to code cleanup or formatting.  Specifically, the  `extend(config, ctx)` function in the `build` section is modified;  Initially it contained two `extend` functions, one with conditional logic for `ctx.isDev`, and a second empty one.  The second `extend` function and the `babel` configuration  are commented out in subsequent commits.  The rest of the `nuxt.config.js` file remains consistent across all three commits, indicating a focus on refining the build process rather than adding or changing core functionality. The file uses various Nuxt.js modules including `@nuxtjs/vuetify`, `@nuxtjs/axios`, `@nuxtjs/dotenv`, `@nuxtjs/proxy`, `nuxt-helmet`, `@nuxtjs/auth-next`, and `@nuxtjs/i18n`, suggesting a complex web application with authentication, internationalization, and various UI components.  The `env` property is also configured to include URLs that may point to external services.
