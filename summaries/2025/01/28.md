# Activity Summary for 1/28/2025

## 12:40:43 PM
The log shows the evolution of a JavaScript file, `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/personal/Musoko-DSA-Series/arrays_objects/employees.js`,  over a period of approximately one hour on January 28th, 2025.  The file initially defined an empty `employees` array.  This array was progressively populated with employee objects, each containing  `id`, `first_name`, `last_name`, `company_ID`, `salary`, and `nationality` attributes.  There were several edits correcting inconsistencies in attribute names (e.g., `company_ID` vs. `companyID`), values (e.g., `nationality` for Jane Boe) and data types.   Around 11:31 AM, a `coompanies` array (later corrected to `companies`) was added and populated with company objects having `id`, `name`, and `address` attributes.  The final modifications, starting around 12:01 PM, involved creating an `employeeGenarateReport` function (later corrected to `employeeGenarateReport`) that iterates through the `employees` array. The function aims to generate a report for each employee by finding the corresponding company from the `companies` array and calculating employee and employer contributions (employee contribution at 5% and employer at 15% of salary).  The function's structure was refined in several steps, ultimately creating a report object with `employeeID`, `name`, and eventually `companyName`.  The final state of the code is a data structure representing employees and companies, along with a function designed to process and present the data.
