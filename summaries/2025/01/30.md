# Activity Summary for 1/30/2025

## 12:14:36 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of the `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/art-jameel.admin/package.json` file between 11:51:38 AM and 11:52:04 AM on January 30, 2025.  The changes primarily involve the `"scripts"` section.  Specifically, there are repeated attempts to modify or remove the  `"devMac"` script, which appears to be a script for development on macOS. The initial version contained two `devMac` entries, one was commented out in the second revision, and then both entries reappeared in the third revision, before one was removed in the final revision. The rest of the `package.json` file, including the extensive list of dependencies, remained consistent throughout all revisions.  The changes suggest debugging or experimentation with the development setup for macOS.
