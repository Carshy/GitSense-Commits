# Activity Summary for 1/30/2025

## 12:14:36 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of the `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/art-jameel.admin/package.json` file between 11:51:38 AM and 11:52:04 AM on January 30, 2025.  The changes primarily involve the `"scripts"` section.  Specifically, there are repeated attempts to modify or remove the  `"devMac"` script, which appears to be a script for development on macOS. The initial version contained two `devMac` entries, one was commented out in the second revision, and then both entries reappeared in the third revision, before one was removed in the final revision. The rest of the `package.json` file, including the extensive list of dependencies, remained consistent throughout all revisions.  The changes suggest debugging or experimentation with the development setup for macOS.


## 1:14:38 PM
The log shows multiple updates to `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/art-jameel.admin/components/admin-central/employment.vue` between 12:59:31 PM and 1:02:41 PM on January 30, 2025.  These updates appear to be minor iterative changes, likely bug fixes or small UI adjustments, as the core functionality of the component remains consistent across all revisions.  The changes do not affect the overall structure of the component, which focuses on employee management, including adding new users and filtering existing ones.  There's a noticeable emphasis on visual elements such as icons, styling (using Vuetify's `v-` components), and responsive design.  The repeated code blocks suggest that the developer may have been experimenting with different layouts or making incremental improvements to existing sections of the code without altering the main functionality.  There is no significant pattern in the content changes other than these minor refinements. The file `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/art-jameel.admin/pages/admin-central/index.vue` was updated once at 12:57:30 PM on the same day. This file is a Vue component displaying an admin dashboard with several features, including a company filter and a card-based interface for navigation using a swiper component.  The code is complex and deals with loading data, skeleton loaders and conditional rendering based on user roles and selected company.
