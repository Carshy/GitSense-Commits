# Activity Summary for 1/24/2025

## 9:50:27 AM
The `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/babilou-admin/pages/payroll/_id.vue` file underwent significant changes on January 24, 2025, at 9:50:04 AM.  The revision involved a substantial restructuring of the UI for payroll processing.  The older version included features for approving/rejecting payrolls, submitting for approval, closing sheets, downloading bank files, viewing comments, and displaying approval flows. It utilized VUE components such as `v-card`, `v-row`, `v-col`, `v-btn`, `v-dialog`, `v-autocomplete`, `v-menu`, `v-tooltip`, `v-data-table` and custom components like `approvalFlow`, `DashboardSS`, `AddNewPayitem`, `ApprovalDialog` and `AddNewPayitemOffCycle`.  The updated version maintains the core functionality but presents it with a revised layout emphasizing a data table for payroll sheet management.  The new version introduced a supplementary sheet generation feature (`handleSupplementarySheetsDialog()`), using a new icon (`/directory/add_plus.svg`).  The data table dynamically displays payroll sheet information, including creation date, type, status, and actions (with conditional rendering of `AddNewPayitem` and `AddNewPayitemOffCycle` based on status and type).  The overall change suggests a move towards a more streamlined and user-friendly interface focused on managing multiple payroll sheets.
