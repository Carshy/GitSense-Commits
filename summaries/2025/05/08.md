# Activity Summary for 5/8/2025

## 8:52:34 AM
The log shows updates to three Vue.js components between 8:06 AM and 8:52 AM on May 8, 2025.

`/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/hecqatar-admin/components/reuseable/salaryAdjustmentBulk.vue`  was updated at 8:06:27 AM. This component handles bulk salary adjustments via CSV upload.  The update includes a modal for CSV preview and processing,  error handling,  a function to generate a downloadable Excel template (`generateExcel()`),  and  backend communication (`getUsersData()`, `getConfig()`) using Axios for fetching user and configuration data.  The component uses PapaParse for CSV parsing and Moment.js for date formatting.  Significant changes involved adding data table for preview and upload functionalities.

`/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/hecqatar-admin/components/admin-central/requests.vue` was updated at 8:21:52 AM. This component displays and manages various types of employee requests (leave, claims, car purchase, etc.).  The update focuses on improving the UI and adding functionality for different request types by using numerous child components like `CreateLeaves`, `CreateCarPurchaseAssistance`, `CreateEducationAssistance`, `CreateFurnishingGrant`, `CreateTimeOffLieu`, `CreateWfh`, `CreatePassportSafekeep`, `CreateLoan`, `ClaimRequest`, `EditAttendance`, and `LetterRequest`. A search feature is implemented for filtering requests.  The component uses a `v-select` to allow selection of request types and employees.

`/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/hecqatar-admin/components/reuseable/teamRequestInfo.vue` was updated multiple times between 8:45:35 AM and 8:52:27 AM.  This component displays details of individual team requests. Updates include adding a preview feature for letters (`PreviewLetter` component) and improving the display of leave requests with tabs for "Request", "History & Summary", and "Leave Buddy".  The component also handles claims and EOSB loan requests.  The updates are iterative, refining the display of request information and adding functionality such as showing probation status and displaying attached files.  A recurring pattern is the use of consistent styling and component structure across different request types.


## 9:50:57 AM
The `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/apis/hecqatar-api/src/services/configuration.service.js` file was updated on 5/8/2025, 9:42:57 AM.  This file contains a service for managing configuration data.  Key changes include the addition and modification of several functions related to configuration creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion.

The `createConfiguration` function creates new configurations, handling cloning from existing configurations and  rejecting requests for the company "Yallah". It utilizes several helper functions (`createNullClaimConfig`, `createNullCoreConfig`, etc.) to create default configurations of various types (Claim, Core, Email, Leave, Letter, Payroll, Shift, User, WFH).  Note that `createNullPayrollConfig` is commented out.

Other functions include:

* `configurationById`: Retrieves a configuration by ID.
* `listAllConfiguration`: Retrieves all configurations.
* `updateConfigurationOnId`: Updates a configuration by ID.  It updates the entire configuration document.
* `updateFieldConfiguration`:  Updates specific fields in a configuration, with special handling for updating or creating mobile instances in a MongoDB collection (`parent_companies`) using a connection string obtained from an environment variable (not shown in the provided log).
* `deleteConfigurationOnId`: Soft deletes (sets `is_deleted` to true) a configuration by ID.
* `updateUpdatedBy`, `updateCreatedBy`: Update the `updated_by` and `created_by` fields respectively.
* `getConfigurationCustom`: Retrieves a configuration based on a custom match and projection.
* `getRequiredFields`: Retrieves specific fields as requested in `reqBody`. Includes sorting for designations.
* `getModules`: Retrieves the `modules` field from a configuration.
* `getSalaryConfigurations`: Makes an external API call using Axios to retrieve salary configurations from a URL defined in an environment variable (not shown in the log).


The code uses MongoDB (`ObjectId`) and Mongoose for database interaction.  Error handling is implemented with consistent return structures (`{ message, data }`).  A recurring pattern is the use of helper functions for creating null configurations for different configuration types.  The use of asynchronous functions (`async/await`) is prevalent throughout the code.


## 9:52:36 AM
The log shows multiple updates to `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/hecqatar-admin/components/reuseable/teamRequestInfo.vue` and `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/hecqatar-admin/components/admin-central/requests.vue` between 8:58 AM and 9:51 AM on May 8, 2025.  The changes in `teamRequestInfo.vue` appear to be minor and likely related to styling or bug fixes, as there are no substantial structural alterations across the multiple commits.  The code consistently displays information related to leave requests, claims, and EOSB loans, suggesting a component for displaying various request types.

The `requests.vue` file underwent more significant changes between 9:28 AM and 9:47 AM. These modifications involved additions and alterations to the component's structure, likely adding or refining the functionality for creating different request types.  Each commit introduces or modifies sections dealing with specific request types ("Leave", "Car Purchase Assistance", "Education Assistance", "Furnishing Grant", "Lieu", "WFH", "Passport Safekeep", "Loan", "Claim", "Attendance", and "Letters"),  each within a `<v-col>`.  The addition of a search bar suggests improvements to the user interface for easier navigation and filtering.  The presence of `<v-select>` components indicates dynamic selection of employees for different requests. The consistent use of Vue.js components like `v-select`, `v-row`, `v-col`, `v-card`, and others indicates a Vue.js-based frontend.


## 12:55:14 PM
The log shows multiple updates to the `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/messe-frankfurt-admin/nuxt.config.js` file between 12:11 PM and 12:43 PM on May 8, 2025.  The content of `nuxt.config.js` remained identical across these revisions, suggesting no functional changes were made to the configuration file during this time.

A separate change occurred to `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/messe-frankfurt-admin/package.json` at 12:46 PM and then again at 12:54 PM. The first `package.json` update shows no discernible difference in the dependencies or scripts sections compared to the subsequent update. However, the second update to `package.json` modifies the `devMac` script, changing the way the development server is started on MacOS systems. The original command was: `"devMac": "NODE_ENV=dev node --max-old-space-size=8192 node_modules/.bin/nuxt"`.  It was changed to: `"devMac": "set NODE_OPTIONS=--max_old_space_size=8192 webpack && cross-env NODE_ENV=dev nodemon server/index.js --watch server"`. This suggests an effort to standardize the development startup across different operating systems by using `webpack` and `nodemon` similarly to other environment scripts.  The `package.json` file lists many dependencies related to UI components, date/time handling, maps, charts, and other front-end functionalities, along with several seemingly in-house modules starting with "@nathangroup".  The project appears to be a large-scale application.  The scripts section indicates support for development (`dev`, `devMac`), staging (`staging`), and production (`production`) environments, including build and start commands for each.


## 1:55:13 PM
The log shows two nearly identical commits to `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/messe-frankfurt-admin/pages/payroll/_id.vue` on May 8th, 2025.  The first commit was at 1:04:02 PM, and the second at 1:04:58 PM.  The changes between the two commits are minimal;  the only apparent difference is a minor typo correction in the tooltip text "Download SIFsssss" changed to "Download SIF". The file itself is a Vue.js component responsible for displaying and managing payroll processes.  It uses a `v-data-table` to show payroll sheets, with various actions available per row, such as adding new pay items (`AddNewPayitem`, `AddNewPayitemOffCycle`), submitting for approval, approving/rejecting, downloading SIF files, viewing logs, and closing sheets.  Conditional rendering based on payroll sheet status (`active`, `inactive`), type (`Monthly`, `Supplementary`), and approval status (`submit_for_approval`) heavily influences which actions are displayed to the user.  The component also appears to handle supplementary payroll generation.  The rapid succession of the commits suggests a quick fix following the initial commit.


## 3:48:59 PM
The provided code represents a Vue.js component for managing requests.  Two nearly identical versions are shown, differing only slightly in their closing tags.  Both versions, timestamped 5/8/2025, 2:51:37 PM and 5/8/2025, 2:54:21 PM, display a form for creating various request types and a section for viewing existing requests.

The component allows users to select a request type from a dropdown (`computeRequestTypeList`).  Depending on the selected type (Leave, Car Purchase Assistance, Education Assistance, Furnishing Grant, Time Off Lieu, WFH, Passport Safekeep, Loan, Claim, Attendance, Letters, Salary Adjustment, EOSB Loan, Salary Advance), a corresponding sub-component is rendered (`CreateLeaves`, `CreateCarPurchaseAssistance`, etc.).  These sub-components likely handle the specific details for each request type.  Employee selection is a common feature across many request types, using a `v-select` component populated by `getEmployee` data.  Claims requests include a tooltip with instructions.  A search functionality (`searchRequests`) is also present for filtering requests.  The UI leverages Vuetify components extensively for its structure and styling.  The minor difference between the two code versions suggests a very small, likely inconsequential, edit was made between the timestamps.
