# Activity Summary for 5/8/2025

## 8:52:34 AM
The log shows updates to three Vue.js components between 8:06 AM and 8:52 AM on May 8, 2025.

`/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/hecqatar-admin/components/reuseable/salaryAdjustmentBulk.vue`  was updated at 8:06:27 AM. This component handles bulk salary adjustments via CSV upload.  The update includes a modal for CSV preview and processing,  error handling,  a function to generate a downloadable Excel template (`generateExcel()`),  and  backend communication (`getUsersData()`, `getConfig()`) using Axios for fetching user and configuration data.  The component uses PapaParse for CSV parsing and Moment.js for date formatting.  Significant changes involved adding data table for preview and upload functionalities.

`/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/hecqatar-admin/components/admin-central/requests.vue` was updated at 8:21:52 AM. This component displays and manages various types of employee requests (leave, claims, car purchase, etc.).  The update focuses on improving the UI and adding functionality for different request types by using numerous child components like `CreateLeaves`, `CreateCarPurchaseAssistance`, `CreateEducationAssistance`, `CreateFurnishingGrant`, `CreateTimeOffLieu`, `CreateWfh`, `CreatePassportSafekeep`, `CreateLoan`, `ClaimRequest`, `EditAttendance`, and `LetterRequest`. A search feature is implemented for filtering requests.  The component uses a `v-select` to allow selection of request types and employees.

`/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/hecqatar-admin/components/reuseable/teamRequestInfo.vue` was updated multiple times between 8:45:35 AM and 8:52:27 AM.  This component displays details of individual team requests. Updates include adding a preview feature for letters (`PreviewLetter` component) and improving the display of leave requests with tabs for "Request", "History & Summary", and "Leave Buddy".  The component also handles claims and EOSB loan requests.  The updates are iterative, refining the display of request information and adding functionality such as showing probation status and displaying attached files.  A recurring pattern is the use of consistent styling and component structure across different request types.
