# Activity Summary for 5/8/2025

## 8:52:34 AM
The log shows updates to three Vue.js components between 8:06 AM and 8:52 AM on May 8, 2025.

`/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/hecqatar-admin/components/reuseable/salaryAdjustmentBulk.vue`  was updated at 8:06:27 AM. This component handles bulk salary adjustments via CSV upload.  The update includes a modal for CSV preview and processing,  error handling,  a function to generate a downloadable Excel template (`generateExcel()`),  and  backend communication (`getUsersData()`, `getConfig()`) using Axios for fetching user and configuration data.  The component uses PapaParse for CSV parsing and Moment.js for date formatting.  Significant changes involved adding data table for preview and upload functionalities.

`/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/hecqatar-admin/components/admin-central/requests.vue` was updated at 8:21:52 AM. This component displays and manages various types of employee requests (leave, claims, car purchase, etc.).  The update focuses on improving the UI and adding functionality for different request types by using numerous child components like `CreateLeaves`, `CreateCarPurchaseAssistance`, `CreateEducationAssistance`, `CreateFurnishingGrant`, `CreateTimeOffLieu`, `CreateWfh`, `CreatePassportSafekeep`, `CreateLoan`, `ClaimRequest`, `EditAttendance`, and `LetterRequest`. A search feature is implemented for filtering requests.  The component uses a `v-select` to allow selection of request types and employees.

`/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/hecqatar-admin/components/reuseable/teamRequestInfo.vue` was updated multiple times between 8:45:35 AM and 8:52:27 AM.  This component displays details of individual team requests. Updates include adding a preview feature for letters (`PreviewLetter` component) and improving the display of leave requests with tabs for "Request", "History & Summary", and "Leave Buddy".  The component also handles claims and EOSB loan requests.  The updates are iterative, refining the display of request information and adding functionality such as showing probation status and displaying attached files.  A recurring pattern is the use of consistent styling and component structure across different request types.


## 9:50:57 AM
The `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/apis/hecqatar-api/src/services/configuration.service.js` file was updated on 5/8/2025, 9:42:57 AM.  This file contains a service for managing configuration data.  Key changes include the addition and modification of several functions related to configuration creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion.

The `createConfiguration` function creates new configurations, handling cloning from existing configurations and  rejecting requests for the company "Yallah". It utilizes several helper functions (`createNullClaimConfig`, `createNullCoreConfig`, etc.) to create default configurations of various types (Claim, Core, Email, Leave, Letter, Payroll, Shift, User, WFH).  Note that `createNullPayrollConfig` is commented out.

Other functions include:

* `configurationById`: Retrieves a configuration by ID.
* `listAllConfiguration`: Retrieves all configurations.
* `updateConfigurationOnId`: Updates a configuration by ID.  It updates the entire configuration document.
* `updateFieldConfiguration`:  Updates specific fields in a configuration, with special handling for updating or creating mobile instances in a MongoDB collection (`parent_companies`) using a connection string obtained from an environment variable (not shown in the provided log).
* `deleteConfigurationOnId`: Soft deletes (sets `is_deleted` to true) a configuration by ID.
* `updateUpdatedBy`, `updateCreatedBy`: Update the `updated_by` and `created_by` fields respectively.
* `getConfigurationCustom`: Retrieves a configuration based on a custom match and projection.
* `getRequiredFields`: Retrieves specific fields as requested in `reqBody`. Includes sorting for designations.
* `getModules`: Retrieves the `modules` field from a configuration.
* `getSalaryConfigurations`: Makes an external API call using Axios to retrieve salary configurations from a URL defined in an environment variable (not shown in the log).


The code uses MongoDB (`ObjectId`) and Mongoose for database interaction.  Error handling is implemented with consistent return structures (`{ message, data }`).  A recurring pattern is the use of helper functions for creating null configurations for different configuration types.  The use of asynchronous functions (`async/await`) is prevalent throughout the code.
