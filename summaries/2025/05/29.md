# Activity Summary for 5/29/2025

## 8:58:52 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to two files: `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/ccl-hrms-admin/components/reuseable/createLoan.vue` and `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/ccl-hrms-admin/plugins/gratuity.js`.  The `createLoan.vue` file, dealing with a loan request form, underwent several updates between 8:15 AM and 8:58 AM on May 29, 2025.  These changes primarily involved minor UI adjustments and additions of logging statements for debugging purposes within the `getUsersPayrollConfig` method. The  `getEmpGratuityCal` method also received an update to include the `eos=null` parameter in its function call. No significant functional changes are evident in the  `createLoan.vue` file revisions.

The `gratuity.js` file, containing gratuity calculation logic, was modified twice, at 8:24 AM and 8:37 AM on the same day. The first update involved adding `[0]` to access the first element of `usersPayrollConfig` in the condition checking for unpaid leaves (`usersPayrollConfig[0]?.eosb.isUnpaidLeaves`). The second update removed some console log statements related to country type and calculation type, and added a new console log displaying the entire `usersPayrollConfig` object.  These modifications suggest refinements in handling of the `usersPayrollConfig` data structure within the gratuity calculation function.  The core gratuity calculation logic remained largely unchanged across the revisions.
