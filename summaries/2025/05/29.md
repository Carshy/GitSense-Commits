# Activity Summary for 5/29/2025

## 8:58:52 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to two files: `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/ccl-hrms-admin/components/reuseable/createLoan.vue` and `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/ccl-hrms-admin/plugins/gratuity.js`.  The `createLoan.vue` file, dealing with a loan request form, underwent several updates between 8:15 AM and 8:58 AM on May 29, 2025.  These changes primarily involved minor UI adjustments and additions of logging statements for debugging purposes within the `getUsersPayrollConfig` method. The  `getEmpGratuityCal` method also received an update to include the `eos=null` parameter in its function call. No significant functional changes are evident in the  `createLoan.vue` file revisions.

The `gratuity.js` file, containing gratuity calculation logic, was modified twice, at 8:24 AM and 8:37 AM on the same day. The first update involved adding `[0]` to access the first element of `usersPayrollConfig` in the condition checking for unpaid leaves (`usersPayrollConfig[0]?.eosb.isUnpaidLeaves`). The second update removed some console log statements related to country type and calculation type, and added a new console log displaying the entire `usersPayrollConfig` object.  These modifications suggest refinements in handling of the `usersPayrollConfig` data structure within the gratuity calculation function.  The core gratuity calculation logic remained largely unchanged across the revisions.


## 9:58:57 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/ccl-hrms-admin/components/reuseable/createLoan.vue` and `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/ccl-hrms-admin/plugins/gratuity.js` on May 29, 2025.

**`/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/ccl-hrms-admin/components/reuseable/createLoan.vue` Updates:**

The `createLoan.vue` component, a Vue.js component for creating loan requests, underwent several revisions between 9:01:27 AM and 9:56:34 AM.  The core functionality remained consistent: fetching loan types, loan requirements, and handling loan request submission.  However,  changes focused primarily on the `getUsersPayrollConfig` method. Initially, it used `this.selectedEmp.company_ID`, but this was later changed to `this.user.company_ID` in a revision at 9:12:39 AM. This likely reflects a shift in how company ID is accessed or handled within the application.  Another significant change at 9:54:28 AM involved adding `existingGratuityInfo` to the data, storing the outcome of `getEmpGratuityCal` and suggesting a reorganization of data handling within the component.  The `getEmpGratuityCal` method, which calculates gratuity, was initially called in `mounted()` but later moved inside `getUsersPayrollConfig`.  There were also minor formatting and logging adjustments across different revisions.


**`/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/ccl-hrms-admin/plugins/gratuity.js` Updates:**

The `gratuity.js` plugin, responsible for gratuity calculations, was updated three times between 9:06:22 AM and 9:20:29 AM. The changes were primarily focused on improving logging statements for debugging purposes.  Specifically, the `typeof` check on `usersPayrollConfig`  was made more explicit in a revision at 9:07:30 AM. Another revision at 9:11:04 AM added the string "payrollconfig" to the log for better context.  These changes suggest iterative debugging and refinement of the gratuity calculation logic, but no fundamental changes to the calculation algorithms themselves were made.  The core gratuity calculation logic for UAE and KSA remained the same across all revisions.


## 10:58:54 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/ccl-hrms-admin/components/reuseable/createLoan.vue`, a Vue.js component for creating loan requests.  The key changes revolve around adding and refining functionality for validating loan requests against an employee's gratuity limit.

The initial versions (10:03:19 AM, 10:05:49 AM, 10:11:27 AM, 10:14:55 AM, 10:15:11 AM) establish the core UI for loan creation, fetching loan types,  requirements, and user payroll configurations via API calls to `/financialconfig/getFinancialConfig/`, `/payrollconfig/get/config/`, and `/loan/request/requirements`.  These versions include input fields for loan type, currency, amount, and duration, along with a display of existing loans. The `createLoanRequest` method handles submission.

A significant change occurs at 10:36:21 AM.  This revision introduces gratuity limit validation. A  `checkGratuityLimit` method is added to calculate the percentage of the requested loan amount relative to the employee's gratuity and compare it against a maximum allowed percentage (`maxGratuityPercentage`), fetched from the `/loan/request/requirements` API. If the limit is exceeded, a dialog (`gratuityLimitDialog`) displays details about the gratuity limit, requested amount, and maximum allowed loan amount. The submit button is disabled (`!exceedsGratuityLimit`) when this limit is exceeded.

The final revisions (10:58:20 AM and 10:58:34 AM) appear to be minor adjustments, likely stylistic or bug fixes, with no substantial functional changes to the gratuity validation logic.

Throughout the log, there is consistent use of  `$axios` for API calls, `$t` for internationalization, and Vuetify components (`v-form`, `v-select`, `v-text-field`, `v-snackbar`, `v-dialog`).  The code uses `moment.js` for date formatting and interacts with a Vuex store (`$store.getters.getToken`, `$store.getters.getSelectedCompanyId`) for authentication and company data.


## 11:58:53 AM
The log shows multiple revisions of the `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/ccl-hrms-admin/components/reuseable/createLoan.vue` file between 11:37 AM and 11:55 AM on May 29, 2025.  The changes primarily focus on refining the gratuity limit validation within a loan creation form.

The initial version (11:37 AM) included a loan application form with fields for loan type, currency, amount, and duration.  It also displayed information about existing loans, if any.  A crucial addition was the `checkGratuityLimit()` method, initiating gratuity validation.

Subsequent updates (11:46 AM and 11:52 AM) improved the gratuity limit exceeded dialog.  The 11:46 AM update added a feature to automatically reset the `loan_amount` to the maximum allowed amount when the gratuity limit is exceeded in the dialog. The 11:52 AM revision further refined the dialog's text, providing clearer messaging regarding the gratuity limit and requested amount.  The heading in the gratuity dialog was changed to `<h3>Gratuity Limit Exceeded</h3>` in the last revision (11:55 AM).


The final version (11:55 AM) is functionally similar to the previous one, but with improved UI and messaging in the gratuity limit exceeded dialog.  There are no significant structural changes to the form itself across all revisions. The  `createLoanRequest()` method was started, but the complete implementation is not visible in the log.  Throughout the revisions, the code consistently interacts with backend APIs (`/financialconfig/getFinancialConfig`, `/loan/request/requirements`, `/payrollconfig/get/config`) using Axios for data fetching and loan request submission.  The code uses Vue.js components (`v-select`, `v-text-field`, `v-dialog`, `v-snackbar`) and demonstrates a pattern of using translated text (`$t()`) for multilingual support.
