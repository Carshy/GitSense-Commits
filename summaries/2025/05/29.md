# Activity Summary for 5/29/2025

## 8:58:52 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to two files: `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/ccl-hrms-admin/components/reuseable/createLoan.vue` and `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/ccl-hrms-admin/plugins/gratuity.js`.  The `createLoan.vue` file, dealing with a loan request form, underwent several updates between 8:15 AM and 8:58 AM on May 29, 2025.  These changes primarily involved minor UI adjustments and additions of logging statements for debugging purposes within the `getUsersPayrollConfig` method. The  `getEmpGratuityCal` method also received an update to include the `eos=null` parameter in its function call. No significant functional changes are evident in the  `createLoan.vue` file revisions.

The `gratuity.js` file, containing gratuity calculation logic, was modified twice, at 8:24 AM and 8:37 AM on the same day. The first update involved adding `[0]` to access the first element of `usersPayrollConfig` in the condition checking for unpaid leaves (`usersPayrollConfig[0]?.eosb.isUnpaidLeaves`). The second update removed some console log statements related to country type and calculation type, and added a new console log displaying the entire `usersPayrollConfig` object.  These modifications suggest refinements in handling of the `usersPayrollConfig` data structure within the gratuity calculation function.  The core gratuity calculation logic remained largely unchanged across the revisions.


## 9:58:57 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/ccl-hrms-admin/components/reuseable/createLoan.vue` and `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/ccl-hrms-admin/plugins/gratuity.js` on May 29, 2025.

**`/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/ccl-hrms-admin/components/reuseable/createLoan.vue` Updates:**

The `createLoan.vue` component, a Vue.js component for creating loan requests, underwent several revisions between 9:01:27 AM and 9:56:34 AM.  The core functionality remained consistent: fetching loan types, loan requirements, and handling loan request submission.  However,  changes focused primarily on the `getUsersPayrollConfig` method. Initially, it used `this.selectedEmp.company_ID`, but this was later changed to `this.user.company_ID` in a revision at 9:12:39 AM. This likely reflects a shift in how company ID is accessed or handled within the application.  Another significant change at 9:54:28 AM involved adding `existingGratuityInfo` to the data, storing the outcome of `getEmpGratuityCal` and suggesting a reorganization of data handling within the component.  The `getEmpGratuityCal` method, which calculates gratuity, was initially called in `mounted()` but later moved inside `getUsersPayrollConfig`.  There were also minor formatting and logging adjustments across different revisions.


**`/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/ccl-hrms-admin/plugins/gratuity.js` Updates:**

The `gratuity.js` plugin, responsible for gratuity calculations, was updated three times between 9:06:22 AM and 9:20:29 AM. The changes were primarily focused on improving logging statements for debugging purposes.  Specifically, the `typeof` check on `usersPayrollConfig`  was made more explicit in a revision at 9:07:30 AM. Another revision at 9:11:04 AM added the string "payrollconfig" to the log for better context.  These changes suggest iterative debugging and refinement of the gratuity calculation logic, but no fundamental changes to the calculation algorithms themselves were made.  The core gratuity calculation logic for UAE and KSA remained the same across all revisions.
