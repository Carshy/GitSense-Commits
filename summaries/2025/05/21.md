# Activity Summary for 5/21/2025

## 12:54:40 PM
The `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/apis/binhendi-api/src/services/payroll.service.js` file, last updated on 5/21/2025 at 12:30:03 PM, contains various functions related to payroll management.  These functions interact with a MongoDB database using Mongoose models (`Payitems`, `PayrollProcess`, `User`, `Companies`, `Notification`, `PayrollConfig`, `MonthlyWisePayitem`, `Recursive`).  The code uses AWS SES for sending emails.

Key functions include:

* **Data Retrieval:**  Numerous functions retrieve payroll data based on various criteria (e.g., `getAllPayrollService`, `getPendingPayItemsForApproveService`, `getPayItemsPayrollByIdService`, `getPayItemsPayrollByCompanyIdService`, `getPayItemsPayrollByIdAndCompanyService`, `getPayItemsPayrollByMonthService`, `getRequestsByRequestId`, `getPayItemsPayrollByPayrollProcessAndCompanyService`, `getPayrollByRecursiveId`, `getEOSPayrollByUserId`).  These functions often utilize aggregation pipelines for efficient data fetching and filtering.

* **Data Manipulation:** Functions for creating new payroll entries (`createNewPayRoll`, `addPayItem`), updating existing entries (`updatePayrollByIdService`), and counting documents (`getPayItemsCountByCompanyIdService`, `getPendingApprovalMonthWiseCountService`) are present.

* **Email and Notification Handling:** The `sendEmailApprover` and `notifications` functions handle sending email approvals and creating database notifications using AWS SES and the `Notification` model, respectively.  These functions are integrated with the `addPayItem` function.

* **Specific Functionality:**  `getEOSPayrollByUserId` appears to handle calculations related to end-of-service payroll, potentially involving recursive calculations based on data in the `Recursive` model.


The code demonstrates a well-structured approach to payroll data management, integrating database interactions, email notifications, and potentially complex calculations. The extensive use of asynchronous functions (`async/await`) ensures efficient handling of database operations.  The use of aggregation pipelines significantly optimizes data retrieval.

The log shows updates to `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/apis/binhendi-api/src/services/payroll_process.service.js` on May 21, 2025.  The first update at 2:13:15 PM contains various asynchronous functions related to payroll processing. These functions interact with several MongoDB models (`PayrollProcess`, `Requests`, `User`, `Configuration`, `PayrollConfig`, `Companies`, etc.) to retrieve and manipulate payroll data.  The code uses aggregation pipelines for efficient data retrieval and includes functionalities for calculating salary adjustments, computing variances between payroll periods, and generating gratuity reports. It utilizes external libraries like `moment`, `lodash`, `@nathangroup/payroll`, and AWS SES for email sending.

The second update at 2:16:34 PM is a minor modification to the `getPayrollProcessComputeVariance` function. This update adds error handling within a `try-catch` block, ensuring the function returns an empty array rather than `undefined` if the variance calculation fails or returns unexpected data. This improves the robustness of the function.  There are no other apparent changes in the code besides this error handling addition.

The `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/binhendi-mcs-admin/components/datatables/salarySheetDT.vue` file was updated on May 21, 2025, at 3:22:17 PM.  This Vue component displays a salary sheet data table.  Significant changes include a refactor of the export functionality, replacing a `<download-excel>` component with individual buttons for XLSX and CSV export driven by the `computedExportFormats` computed property which gets export formats from the config.  The export process now includes a loading overlay.  The table dynamically generates headers based on the data in `this.config` (fixed, earning, recurring_earning, deduction, recurring_deduction fields), showing only columns with non-zero values.  The component also highlights employees with salary adjustments using a red information icon.  It fetches data using Axios, including an optional pension computation step based on the `config`.  The `getHeaders` computed property processes the configuration data to build the table headers dynamically, and it utilizes helper functions for formatting numbers (`amountFormatter`) and converting strings to lowercase (`services_general.tolower`).  Data is sorted alphabetically by first name (`computeSalarySheetDOJ`). The component interacts with a parent component through an `emit('selectedEmp', item)` event.
