# Activity Summary for 5/10/2025

## 4:41:15 PM
The `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/personal/tell_media_admin/src/app/dashboard1/page.tsx` file was updated on 5/10/2025, 4:27:37 PM.  This update involved a significant revision of the AdminDashboard component.  The changes implement a user dashboard with authentication checks.  The component now features:

* **Authentication and Role-Based Redirection:**  The component verifies user authentication and redirects users based on their roles (`admin`, `moderator`, `writer`). Unauthenticated users are redirected to the root (`/`) path.

* **User Profile Fetching:** If authenticated, the component fetches the user's profile using `dispatch(fetchUserProfile())`.

* **UI Enhancements:** The UI has been significantly improved, implementing a sidebar with navigation links, a user profile section (including a placeholder for a profile picture), and a main content area.  The styling uses Tailwind CSS.  The sidebar includes links to "Dashboard," "User Management," "Content Management," and "System Settings".  A logout button is also included.

* **Loading State:** A loading indicator is displayed while fetching user data.

* **Responsive Design:** The layout appears designed to be responsive using flexbox.


The code uses React, Next.js navigation (`useRouter`), Redux (`useAppSelector`, `useAppDispatch`), and Next.js Image component. The styling heavily relies on Tailwind CSS classes.  The SVG icons for navigation and logout are also embedded in the component.
