# Activity Summary for 5/24/2025

## 9:29:55 PM
The file `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/personal/tell_a_tale_spot/tell_tales/users/urls.py` was updated on May 24, 2025 at 9:23:34 PM.  The update involved defining URL patterns for user authentication and profile management using Django REST framework.  Specifically, it uses a `DefaultRouter` to register viewsets for user registration (`RegisterViewSet`), profile management (`ProfileViewSet`), and logout (`LogoutViewSet`).  Additionally, it includes explicit URL paths for login (`LoginView`) and token refresh (`TokenRefreshView`) using `rest_framework_simplejwt`. The code uses standard Django and DRF practices for routing and view handling.
