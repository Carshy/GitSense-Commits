# Activity Summary for 5/24/2025

## 9:29:55 PM
The file `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/personal/tell_a_tale_spot/tell_tales/users/urls.py` was updated on May 24, 2025 at 9:23:34 PM.  The update involved defining URL patterns for user authentication and profile management using Django REST framework.  Specifically, it uses a `DefaultRouter` to register viewsets for user registration (`RegisterViewSet`), profile management (`ProfileViewSet`), and logout (`LogoutViewSet`).  Additionally, it includes explicit URL paths for login (`LoginView`) and token refresh (`TokenRefreshView`) using `rest_framework_simplejwt`. The code uses standard Django and DRF practices for routing and view handling.

The `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/personal/tell_media_admin/src/app/users/layout.tsx` file underwent two major revisions on May 24, 2025.

The first revision (9:46:04 PM) established a responsive sidebar layout for a user admin dashboard.  The sidebar includes navigation items for Dashboard, User Management, Content Management, and System Settings.  User authentication and role-based redirection are implemented using Redux.  The layout dynamically adjusts based on screen size and user role, displaying a loading indicator if the user is not an admin.  The sidebar collapses on smaller screens.

The second revision (10:02:11 PM) refined the sidebar's responsiveness and design.  Key changes include:

*   **Sidebar Width:** On mobile, the sidebar now occupies 60% of the screen width instead of collapsing completely.  On larger screens, it remains at 64px width.
*   **Sidebar Toggle:**  A visible toggle button was added to the sidebar header itself to control its visibility, replacing the separate toggle button outside the sidebar.  The toggle button's design was also updated.
*   **Navigation Item Styling:**  The styling of navigation items remains consistent, but extra unnecessary classes were removed.
*   **Main Content Margin:** The main content area now dynamically adjusts its left margin based on the sidebar's open/closed state for smoother transitions.
*   **Mobile Overlay:** The `z-index` property was removed in the mobile overlay, making it less of a priority.

Both revisions involved significant updates to the layout's styling and responsive behavior, focusing on improving the user interface and experience, particularly for mobile users. The core functionality of user authentication, role-based redirection, and sidebar navigation remained consistent throughout both updates.
