# Activity Summary for 5/17/2025

## 7:33:48 AM
The log shows iterative development of a simple Node.js HTTP server within the `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/personal/nodeJS-crash-course/server.js` file.  All changes are focused on this single file.

The initial version (7:22:26 AM) creates a basic server that responds with "Hello Collins, welcome to node js". Subsequent commits progressively improve the server.  At 7:23:00 AM, a seemingly unintentional `console.log()` was added (without any arguments). At 7:23:46 AM, `server.listen()` was added, starting the server without specifying a port. Finally, at 7:25:06 AM, the server is correctly configured to listen on port 8000, and a console message confirms the port in use.  The core functionality remains consistent throughout, focusing solely on the server creation and listening behavior. The pattern shows a rapid, iterative development process, quickly building a functional server.


## 10:36:19 AM
The log shows a single file, `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/personal/nodeJS-crash-course/server.js`, undergoing numerous modifications throughout the morning of May 17th, 2025.  The file is a simple Node.js HTTP server.

Initially (7:39:53 AM), the server sent a basic "Hello" message.  Subsequent changes (7:58:02 AM - 8:02:01 AM) involved minor edits to the response text and a brief removal and re-addition of a `res.write` line.  Significant changes started around 8:02 AM with the addition of HTTP headers, specifically setting the `Content-Type` to `text/html` (8:02:56 AM) and modifying the response body to include HTML (8:06:37 AM).  A small typographical correction was made to the HTML message at 8:07:39 AM.

Between 9:43:15 AM and 9:49:59 AM, the code underwent a more substantial revision.  The earlier response was commented out, and the server was modified to send a 500 error response with a JSON body indicating a server error.  This involved several incremental steps, including setting the status code, adding the `Content-Type` header for JSON, and constructing the JSON message.  Finally, at 10:16:16 AM, the commented-out lines from the previous version were removed, leaving only the 500 error response code and JSON message.  The overall pattern is iterative development, with multiple minor adjustments and a later, more substantial refactor to implement error handling.
