# Activity Summary for 5/17/2025

## 7:33:48 AM
The log shows iterative development of a simple Node.js HTTP server within the `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/personal/nodeJS-crash-course/server.js` file.  All changes are focused on this single file.

The initial version (7:22:26 AM) creates a basic server that responds with "Hello Collins, welcome to node js". Subsequent commits progressively improve the server.  At 7:23:00 AM, a seemingly unintentional `console.log()` was added (without any arguments). At 7:23:46 AM, `server.listen()` was added, starting the server without specifying a port. Finally, at 7:25:06 AM, the server is correctly configured to listen on port 8000, and a console message confirms the port in use.  The core functionality remains consistent throughout, focusing solely on the server creation and listening behavior. The pattern shows a rapid, iterative development process, quickly building a functional server.
