# Activity Summary for 5/26/2025

## 9:38:33 AM
The log shows the development of a simple Express.js web server.  Initially, a basic server was created on port 8000 (8:41 AM), with minor edits to the `PORT` variable declaration style (8:42 AM) and a correction in the console log message (8:44 AM).  A GET route was added at 8:55 AM to display a message.

Significant changes occurred around 9:00 AM.  `package.json` was updated to include `start` and `dev` scripts for easier execution (9:02 AM). The server's message was modified (9:03 AM), the port was changed to 8080 (9:05 AM), and an additional route `/about` was added (9:07 AM), with its path corrected from `/` to `/about` (9:08 AM).

A shift towards serving static files began around 9:18 AM.  The `path` module was introduced, and attempts were made to serve `index.html` (initially with errors in path construction).  A `public` directory was created to hold static files, starting with `index.html` (9:20 AM) and followed by `about.html` (9:21 AM, initially empty then containing content). The server was updated to correctly serve both `index.html` and `about.html`  (9:23 AM). Finally, at 9:31 AM, the server code was simplified to use `express.static` to serve the entire `public` directory, removing the need for individual route handlers for each file.  Throughout the log, there were minor, mostly typographical corrections and refinements.
