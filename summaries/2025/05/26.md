# Activity Summary for 5/26/2025

## 9:38:33 AM
The log shows the development of a simple Express.js web server.  Initially, a basic server was created on port 8000 (8:41 AM), with minor edits to the `PORT` variable declaration style (8:42 AM) and a correction in the console log message (8:44 AM).  A GET route was added at 8:55 AM to display a message.

Significant changes occurred around 9:00 AM.  `package.json` was updated to include `start` and `dev` scripts for easier execution (9:02 AM). The server's message was modified (9:03 AM), the port was changed to 8080 (9:05 AM), and an additional route `/about` was added (9:07 AM), with its path corrected from `/` to `/about` (9:08 AM).

A shift towards serving static files began around 9:18 AM.  The `path` module was introduced, and attempts were made to serve `index.html` (initially with errors in path construction).  A `public` directory was created to hold static files, starting with `index.html` (9:20 AM) and followed by `about.html` (9:21 AM, initially empty then containing content). The server was updated to correctly serve both `index.html` and `about.html`  (9:23 AM). Finally, at 9:31 AM, the server code was simplified to use `express.static` to serve the entire `public` directory, removing the need for individual route handlers for each file.  Throughout the log, there were minor, mostly typographical corrections and refinements.


## 10:44:31 AM
The log shows updates to two Vue.js components: `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/ccl-hrms-admin/pages/index.vue` and `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/ccl-hrms-admin/components/configurations/FinancialRequests.vue`.

`/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/ccl-hrms-admin/pages/index.vue` was modified twice within a short time frame (5/26/2025, 10:21:41 AM and 5/26/2025, 10:22:56 AM).  The changes between these two commits appear minimal; a detailed diff would be needed to pinpoint the exact differences, but the code strongly suggests no functional changes were made, only very minor cosmetic ones (whitespace differences are highly likely). This file is a login page with options for Outlook login and standard username/password authentication, including features for OTP verification and password reset.

`/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/ccl-hrms-admin/components/configurations/FinancialRequests.vue` was updated at 10:37:25 AM and then again at 10:42:56 AM.  These two commits are nearly identical, therefore the changes are unlikely to be significant. This component manages financial requests (salary advances, loans, allowances) within the application.  It includes features for creating, editing, viewing, deleting and translating these requests, incorporating functionalities like eligibility selection, attachment requirements, conditional amount calculations, and access control.  The component uses Vuetify for the UI and integrates with translation services. The structure is very complex, suggesting a large and feature-rich component.
