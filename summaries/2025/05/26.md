# Activity Summary for 5/26/2025

## 9:38:33 AM
The log shows the development of a simple Express.js web server.  Initially, a basic server was created on port 8000 (8:41 AM), with minor edits to the `PORT` variable declaration style (8:42 AM) and a correction in the console log message (8:44 AM).  A GET route was added at 8:55 AM to display a message.

Significant changes occurred around 9:00 AM.  `package.json` was updated to include `start` and `dev` scripts for easier execution (9:02 AM). The server's message was modified (9:03 AM), the port was changed to 8080 (9:05 AM), and an additional route `/about` was added (9:07 AM), with its path corrected from `/` to `/about` (9:08 AM).

A shift towards serving static files began around 9:18 AM.  The `path` module was introduced, and attempts were made to serve `index.html` (initially with errors in path construction).  A `public` directory was created to hold static files, starting with `index.html` (9:20 AM) and followed by `about.html` (9:21 AM, initially empty then containing content). The server was updated to correctly serve both `index.html` and `about.html`  (9:23 AM). Finally, at 9:31 AM, the server code was simplified to use `express.static` to serve the entire `public` directory, removing the need for individual route handlers for each file.  Throughout the log, there were minor, mostly typographical corrections and refinements.


## 10:44:31 AM
The log shows updates to two Vue.js components: `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/ccl-hrms-admin/pages/index.vue` and `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/ccl-hrms-admin/components/configurations/FinancialRequests.vue`.

`/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/ccl-hrms-admin/pages/index.vue` was modified twice within a short time frame (5/26/2025, 10:21:41 AM and 5/26/2025, 10:22:56 AM).  The changes between these two commits appear minimal; a detailed diff would be needed to pinpoint the exact differences, but the code strongly suggests no functional changes were made, only very minor cosmetic ones (whitespace differences are highly likely). This file is a login page with options for Outlook login and standard username/password authentication, including features for OTP verification and password reset.

`/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/ccl-hrms-admin/components/configurations/FinancialRequests.vue` was updated at 10:37:25 AM and then again at 10:42:56 AM.  These two commits are nearly identical, therefore the changes are unlikely to be significant. This component manages financial requests (salary advances, loans, allowances) within the application.  It includes features for creating, editing, viewing, deleting and translating these requests, incorporating functionalities like eligibility selection, attachment requirements, conditional amount calculations, and access control.  The component uses Vuetify for the UI and integrates with translation services. The structure is very complex, suggesting a large and feature-rich component.


## 2:51:46 PM
The `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/ccl-hrms-admin/components/admin-central/requests.vue` file was updated on 5/26/2025, 2:13:14 PM.  This update significantly revised the component's UI, primarily focusing on request creation and display.  The changes introduce a robust system for handling various request types (leave, lieu, loan, WFH, claims, attendance adjustments, salary adjustments, trips, letters, grade changes, designation changes, bank details, and passport safekeeping).

The component now includes:

* **A request type selector:**  Users select the request type from a dropdown, dynamically rendering different forms based on the selection.
* **Employee selection:** An autocomplete field allows selection of an employee for the request.
* **Individual request components:**  Separate components (`CreateLeaves`, `CreateTimeOffLieu`, `CreateLoan`, `CreateWfh`, `NewClaimRequest`, `EditAttendance`, `CreateSalaryAdjustment`, `CreateTripRequest`, `LetterRequest`, `CreateGradeChangeRequest`, `CreateDesignationChangeRequest`, `BankDetailsRequest`, `CreatePassportSafekeep`, `CreateSalaryAdvance`) handle the creation and submission of each request type.  These are conditionally rendered based on the selected request type.
* **Request listing:** A scrollable list displays existing requests, with filtering and searching capabilities.  There's a visual distinction between pending and all requests.
* **Support ticket section:**  A dedicated section manages support tickets, offering search and sorting options by status (All, New, In Progress, Resolved, Cancelled).

The code extensively uses Vue.js components and integrates with a backend for fetching employee data and handling requests. The use of internationalization (`$t`) suggests multilingual support.  The large number of conditionally rendered components suggests a complex system for managing various types of employee requests within the HRMS.  The component uses Vuetify components for UI elements.  Error handling and loading indicators are also present.


## 4:05:30 PM
The `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/ccl-hrms-admin/components/reuseable/createLoan.vue` file underwent two revisions on May 26, 2025.

**First Revision (3:10:58 PM):** This version included a Vue.js component for creating loan requests.  It featured input fields for loan type, currency, amount, and duration, along with validation rules.  The component dynamically displayed existing loan information, including available balance and current gratuity balance (if applicable).  A progress indicator appeared during loan submission.  Error handling and feedback mechanisms were in place via snackbars and dialogs.  The code also included functions to fetch loan requirements, calculate monthly payments, and handle gratuity loan specifics.


**Second Revision (3:14:59 PM):**  The primary change in this revision was the addition of functionality to actually submit the loan request.  The `createLoanRequest` method was enhanced to send a POST request to the `/loan/request/new` endpoint. The previous gratuity exceeded dialog was removed.  Successful submissions triggered a success snackbar and form reset. Failed submissions showed an error message.  The component now included additional data fields for the API request, specifically `applied_manager`, and `user_id`.  A commented-out section related to `computedLoanAmount` was present.  The `loanPercentRules` validation was simplified, removing gratuity-specific logic.  Finally, the component now directly calls methods for refreshing the request list after successful loan creation.


## 5:05:30 PM
The `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/ccl-hrms-admin/components/reuseable/createLoan.vue` file underwent two revisions on May 26, 2025.  The first revision (4:22:58 PM) shows a Vue component for creating loan requests. It features a form with fields for loan type, currency, amount, and duration, along with logic to calculate available loan amount based on existing loans and salary information.  The component interacts with backend APIs (`/loan/request/requirements`, `/loan/request/new`, `/financialconfig/getFinancialConfig`, `/generic/upload`) to fetch loan requirements, submit new loan requests and upload files. It also uses Vuetify components for UI elements (e.g., `v-select`, `v-text-field`, `v-snackbar`, `v-progress-circular`).


The second revision (4:32:59 PM) adds an `async fetchGratuity()` method to the component's script section.  Notably, the implementation of this method is empty (`console.log("fetch gratuituy")`), suggesting it's a placeholder or work in progress for fetching gratuity information, which is not yet integrated into the loan request process.  Otherwise the core functionality remains the same.  The timestamp difference between the revisions suggests a quick iteration with the addition of a new feature (gratuity handling), which is not fully implemented.
