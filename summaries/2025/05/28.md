# Activity Summary for 5/28/2025

## 9:42:52 AM
The log shows a single code change on May 28, 2025, at 8:54:58 AM, to `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/ccl-hrms-admin/components/reuseable/createLoan.vue`.  This file is a Vue.js component for creating loan requests.

The update significantly modifies the component's UI, adding input fields for loan type, currency, amount, and duration.  It also includes functionality to display existing loan information, calculate monthly payments, and submit a new loan request.  The component interacts with backend APIs (`/financialconfig/getFinancialConfig/`, `/payrollconfig/get/config/`, `/loan/request/requirements`, `/loan/request/new`, `/loan/request/users/`) using Axios for data fetching and submission.  The code uses Vuetify components (e.g., `v-select`, `v-text-field`, `v-snackbar`).  Error handling and user feedback mechanisms (snackbars) are implemented.  The component uses moment.js for date formatting and includes custom validation rules for input fields.  A progress indicator is shown during API calls.  The component also fetches and displays existing loan details, including total available amount, existing active loan amounts, and due amounts for each loan.  There's a significant amount of i18n (internationalization) using `$t()` for multilingual support.  Finally, the code includes gratuity calculations using a separate `getGratuityCalculations` function, likely integrating with payroll systems.


## 10:42:51 AM
The log shows updates to two Vue.js components: `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/ccl-hrms-admin/pages/index.vue` and `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/ccl-hrms-admin/components/Bell.vue`.

The `/pages/index.vue` file was updated twice on May 28, 2025, with very minor edits between 10:29:04 AM and 10:30:16 AM.  Both versions contain extensive Vue.js code for a login page, including username/password fields,  OTP verification, password reset functionality, and  handling of various views (`username`, `otp`, `createPasswordView`, `forgotPasswordView`).  The code is highly structured using Vuetify components and  internationalization (`$t`) for multi-language support.


The `/components/Bell.vue` file was updated once on May 28, 2025, at 10:35:08 AM. This component renders a notification bell that displays a count of unread notifications.  Clicking the bell opens a menu showing notifications, with options to mark all as read and view all notifications. The component uses Axios for API calls to fetch and update notification read status, Moment.js for date formatting, and Vuetify for UI elements.  The code demonstrates efficient handling of notification data, including fetching in batches and updating read status individually.
