# Activity Summary for 5/28/2025

## 9:42:52 AM
The log shows a single code change on May 28, 2025, at 8:54:58 AM, to `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/ccl-hrms-admin/components/reuseable/createLoan.vue`.  This file is a Vue.js component for creating loan requests.

The update significantly modifies the component's UI, adding input fields for loan type, currency, amount, and duration.  It also includes functionality to display existing loan information, calculate monthly payments, and submit a new loan request.  The component interacts with backend APIs (`/financialconfig/getFinancialConfig/`, `/payrollconfig/get/config/`, `/loan/request/requirements`, `/loan/request/new`, `/loan/request/users/`) using Axios for data fetching and submission.  The code uses Vuetify components (e.g., `v-select`, `v-text-field`, `v-snackbar`).  Error handling and user feedback mechanisms (snackbars) are implemented.  The component uses moment.js for date formatting and includes custom validation rules for input fields.  A progress indicator is shown during API calls.  The component also fetches and displays existing loan details, including total available amount, existing active loan amounts, and due amounts for each loan.  There's a significant amount of i18n (internationalization) using `$t()` for multilingual support.  Finally, the code includes gratuity calculations using a separate `getGratuityCalculations` function, likely integrating with payroll systems.


## 10:42:51 AM
The log shows updates to two Vue.js components: `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/ccl-hrms-admin/pages/index.vue` and `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/ccl-hrms-admin/components/Bell.vue`.

The `/pages/index.vue` file was updated twice on May 28, 2025, with very minor edits between 10:29:04 AM and 10:30:16 AM.  Both versions contain extensive Vue.js code for a login page, including username/password fields,  OTP verification, password reset functionality, and  handling of various views (`username`, `otp`, `createPasswordView`, `forgotPasswordView`).  The code is highly structured using Vuetify components and  internationalization (`$t`) for multi-language support.


The `/components/Bell.vue` file was updated once on May 28, 2025, at 10:35:08 AM. This component renders a notification bell that displays a count of unread notifications.  Clicking the bell opens a menu showing notifications, with options to mark all as read and view all notifications. The component uses Axios for API calls to fetch and update notification read status, Moment.js for date formatting, and Vuetify for UI elements.  The code demonstrates efficient handling of notification data, including fetching in batches and updating read status individually.


## 12:43:34 PM
The log shows modifications to two Vue.js components: `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/ccl-hrms-admin/components/EOS/calculator.vue` and `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/ccl-hrms-admin/components/reuseable/createLoan.vue`.

The `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/ccl-hrms-admin/components/EOS/calculator.vue` component underwent multiple revisions between 12:00 PM and 12:06 PM on May 28, 2025.  These revisions appear to be minor adjustments and do not show any substantial changes in functionality.  The code primarily focuses on an employee's end-of-service (EOS) benefits calculator, displaying employee information, exit details (last working day, exit status), leave information (paid and unpaid leave days), and payroll items.  The component uses Vuetify for UI elements and interacts with backend services (`services_general`) for retrieving employee data and images.  Calculations are performed within the component, particularly around leave encashment amounts, using different formulas based on work schedules and configuration settings (`selectedUserPayrollConfig`).

The `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/ccl-hrms-admin/components/reuseable/createLoan.vue` component was updated at 12:12:58 PM on May 28, 2025. This component is a reusable loan request form.  It allows users to select a loan type, enter the loan amount and duration, and provide a description. The component fetches loan types from a backend API (`fetchFinanceConfig`) and calculates monthly payments (`computedMonthlyPayment`).  It also displays information about existing loans,  validates user input, and submits the loan request to a backend endpoint (`createLoanRequest`). The component uses Vuetify components and integrates with notification and general utility plugins.  The `createLoanRequest` method handles the submission, displaying success or error messages using a snackbar.  The component also appears to interact with employee data, possibly to determine loan eligibility based on existing loan balances (`existingLoanInfo`).


## 1:43:35 PM
The log shows multiple updates to two Vue.js components: `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/ccl-hrms-admin/components/EOS/calculator.vue` and `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/ccl-hrms-admin/components/reuseable/createLoan.vue`.  Both components underwent iterative development on May 28th, 2025.

`/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/ccl-hrms-admin/components/EOS/calculator.vue`  received four updates between 1:32 PM and 1:38 PM.  These updates appear to be minor adjustments and bug fixes, primarily focusing on the component's UI and functionality related to End of Service (EOS) calculations. No substantial structural changes were made; rather, the modifications involved refinements to existing features. The changes are related to input fields, date pickers, and the display of employee information and pay items.  The `computedLeaveAmount` and `eligibleNumberOfLeaves` methods  handle calculations based on leave days and salary information.  The component uses various Vuetify components (`v-autocomplete`, `v-select`, `v-text-field`, `v-date-picker`, etc.) and relies on external plugins for functionality like date formatting, number-to-words conversion, and gratuity calculations.


`/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/ccl-hrms-admin/components/reuseable/createLoan.vue` received four updates between 1:34 PM and 1:40 PM.  These updates also seem to be incremental improvements and likely bug fixes, rather than major feature additions. The component is responsible for creating loan requests. It retrieves loan types from a backend API (`fetchFinanceConfig`). The `fetchLoanRequirements` function fetches loan requirements based on the selected loan type.  The  `createLoanRequest` method handles submission of loan requests to the backend, including error handling and UI feedback through snackbars.  The component is highly dependent on backend API calls for data retrieval and submission.  The use of `moment.js` for date handling and a custom `notificationMethod` is noticeable.  The component's structure remains consistent throughout the edits.


## 1:43:45 PM
The code changes reflect updates to a payroll processing system API.  The `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/apis/ccl-hrms-api/src/services/payroll_process.service.js` file underwent significant modifications between 1:15:38 PM and 1:17:12 PM on May 28, 2025,  but the content remains largely the same in both commits.  This file contains numerous asynchronous functions (`async`) for retrieving and manipulating payroll data.  These functions interact with various database models (PayrollProcess, Requests, User, Configuration, etc.) using Mongoose and perform aggregation operations.  There's extensive use of `moment.js` for date manipulation and a third-party payroll library (`@nathangroup/payroll`). Several functions focus on retrieving payroll data based on various filters (company ID, status, pay month, etc.). The `getPayrollProcessComputeGratuity` function calculates gratuity based on various configurations and employee data, demonstrating a complex business logic.

The `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/apis/ccl-hrms-api/src/controllers/payroll_process.controller.js` file (updated at 1:22:20 PM on May 28, 2025) implements API endpoints that correspond to the service functions.  Each controller function uses `catchAsync` middleware for error handling and includes logging using a custom logger service.  The logging includes user information and action details which is consistent across all endpoints. The controller methods handle various requests related to payroll processing, including fetching data, computing payroll, and calculating variance.

Finally, the `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/apis/ccl-hrms-api/src/routes/index.js` file (updated at 1:26:35 PM on May 28, 2025) defines the routing for the API, including the addition of a route for `PayrollProcessRoute` which links the controllers and service functions defined in the earlier files.  This file shows a large number of routes, suggesting a comprehensive HRMS system with many features beyond payroll.  The structure is consistent with defining an Express.js API.


## 2:43:33 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to a gratuity calculation plugin (`gratuity.js`) and a loan creation component (`createLoan.vue`).

`/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/ccl-hrms-admin/plugins/gratuity.js` underwent several updates between 1:45 PM and 1:49 PM on May 28, 2025.  These changes primarily involved adding or modifying `console.log` statements for debugging purposes within the `getGratuityCalculations` function. The core gratuity calculation logic, handling different country types ("UAE" and "KSA") and calculation methods, remained consistent across these revisions.  The primary difference was the addition of debugging statements, suggesting iterative debugging and testing of the gratuity calculation.

`/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/ccl-hrms-admin/components/reuseable/createLoan.vue` was modified three times between 1:56 PM and 2:03 PM on May 28, 2025.  These changes focused on the `getUsersPayrollConfig` method, adding a `console.log` statement to output `this.selectedUserPayrollConfig`. This suggests debugging efforts were also made in the loan component  to understand the data flow and values being used within the component. No major functional changes to the loan creation functionality are evident.


## 3:48:08 PM
The log shows a single code change on May 28, 2025, at 2:49:33 PM, to the `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/ccl-hrms-admin/components/reuseable/createLoan.vue` file.  This file is a Vue.js component responsible for creating loan requests.

The updated component includes a form for loan application with fields for loan type, currency, amount, loan months, and description.  It uses Vuetify components (`v-form`, `v-select`, `v-text-field`, `v-textarea`, `v-btn`, etc.) for the user interface.  The component fetches loan types from a `/financialconfig/getFinancialConfig/` endpoint and loan requirements from a `/loan/request/requirements` endpoint. It also handles existing loan information displayed in a card.  The `createLoanRequest` method submits the loan application to the `/loan/request/new` endpoint.

The component uses several methods to interact with backend services, including `fetchFinanceConfig`, `getUsersPayrollConfig`, `fetchLoanRequirements`, `getEmpGratuityCal`, `createLoanRequest`, `getData`, and `uploadFile`.  Error handling and progress indicators (`v-progress-linear`, `v-progress-circular`) are implemented.  The component uses internationalization (`$t`) for text.  There is also client-side validation using rules within the Vuetify form components. The component leverages moment.js for date formatting.  The code includes logic to handle potential errors during API calls and displays appropriate snackbar messages to the user.  The component also interacts with the Vuex store to get user information and authentication tokens (`this.$store.getters.getToken`).  Finally, it shows existing loan information fetched from backend and calculates the total available amount for loans.


## 4:48:09 PM
The provided log shows changes made to two files: `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/ccl-hrms-admin/plugins/gratuity.js` and `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/ccl-hrms-admin/components/EOS/calculator.vue`.

The `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/ccl-hrms-admin/plugins/gratuity.js` file underwent three revisions on May 28, 2025.  The primary function, `getGratuityCalculations`, calculates gratuity amounts based on various parameters including user information, date of joining, exit status, and country-specific rules (UAE and KSA). The changes between revisions primarily involved bug fixes and addition of console logs for debugging.  Specifically, revisions removed unnecessary quotes around numerical values in conditional statements and added extensive logging statements to track the calculation process for debugging purposes, which were added between 4:06:21 PM and 4:08:24 PM.  The core gratuity calculation logic remained consistent, but the added logging significantly improves the file's debugging capabilities.


The `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/ccl-hrms-admin/components/EOS/calculator.vue` file shows a single revision at 4:43:02 PM on May 28, 2025. This Vue component is an EOS (End of Service) calculator.  It includes a user interface allowing selection of employees, input of exit information (last working day, exit status), leave details (paid and unpaid), and additional pay items. The component uses a `gratuity` plugin (the file modified earlier) and calculates leave amounts based on various configuration settings. It also features input validation using rules and utilizes several helper functions from a `services_general` plugin for tasks such as formatting, data fetching, and image retrieval.  The component dynamically updates the total compensation based on user input and displays the information using Vuetify components.


## 4:48:26 PM
The `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/apis/ccl-hrms-api/src/services/payrollConfig.service.js` file was updated on May 28, 2025, at 4:35:49 PM.  The update involved adding and modifying functions related to payroll configuration management.

The key changes include:

* **CRUD operations for payroll configurations:**  The code implements functions for creating (`createPayrollConfiguration`), retrieving (`getPayrollbyCompanyID`, `listAllPayrollConfig`, `getPayrollConfig`, `getPayrollConfigById`, `getPayrollConfigByUserId`), updating (`updatePayrollConfigOnCompanyId`, `updatePayrollConfig`, `updateSpecificFieldsInPayrollConfig`, `updateBankFileConfig`, `updateSifDetails`, `updateSifDetailsOwnFormat`), and deleting (`deletePayrollConfig`) payroll configurations.  These functions utilize the `payrollConfigModel` and interact with a MongoDB database using `ObjectId` and aggregation pipelines.  Error handling using `ApiError` and `http-status` is implemented throughout.

* **Data retrieval and formatting:** Functions like `getUsersFieldsDynamicSif` and `getUsersFieldsKeyValue` are designed to retrieve and format user data fields for use in payroll processes, likely for generating reports or integrating with other systems. `getUsersFieldsDynamicSif` dynamically generates key-value pairs based on configuration data, while `getUsersFieldsKeyValue` provides a static set of key-value pairs mapping user data fields.

* **Specific field updates:** The code includes functions to update specific fields within payroll configurations (`updateSpecificFieldsInPayrollConfig`) and bank file configurations (`updateBankFileConfig`), highlighting the need for granular control over data updates.

* **SIF (Standard Interface File) configuration:** Several functions (`updateSifDetails`, `updateSifDetailsOwnFormat`) manage the configuration of SIF details, indicating integration with a payroll system that uses this format for data exchange.  These functions handle parameters such as `sif_format_type`, payment modes, and employer and employee record types.

The code heavily relies on MongoDB's aggregation framework for efficient data retrieval and manipulation, utilizing `$match`, `$project`, and `$set` operators within update functions.  Error handling is consistent throughout the functions, throwing `ApiError` exceptions based on HTTP status codes for various scenarios, such as not finding a record or receiving invalid input.  The extensive use of asynchronous functions (`async/await`) points to an application design optimized for concurrency.


## 6:30:01 PM
The log shows significant changes to the `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/personal/tell_media_admin/src/components/reusable/homeHeader.tsx` and `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/personal/tell_media_admin/src/components/reusable/dashboardHeader.tsx` files between 5:33 PM and 6:29 PM on May 28, 2025.

`dashboardHeader.tsx`: This component remained largely unchanged except for a few minor updates to styling and structure. Its primary function, displaying a dashboard header with time, date, user information, and a quote, remained consistent.

`homeHeader.tsx`:  This component underwent substantial revision. Initially, it was a simple "Home" heading.  It then evolved to include images, specifically icons for home, settings, and notifications.  There were several commits iteratively adding and modifying these icons and their associated alt text. The final version shows three icons, but still includes a duplicated `myHome` icon at the end, suggesting the development might not be fully complete.  Importantly, the final commit added a partially completed line `const {user}` within the `HomeHeader` component.  This incomplete line suggests that further work is planned to integrate user data into this header component.  The timestamps for the changes to this file are 5:34 PM, 6:00 PM, 6:02 PM, 6:12 PM, 6:16 PM, 6:18 PM (twice, indicating two very close edits), and 6:29 PM.

A new file, `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/personal/tell_media_admin/src/app/users/layout.tsx`, was added at 6:28 PM. This component creates a user layout with a sidebar containing navigation items, user profile information, and a logout button.  The sidebar is responsive, collapsing on smaller screens.  It also includes role-based redirection: if the logged in user is not an admin, they will be redirected to a different dashboard based on their role.  The component efficiently handles loading states during redirection and user profile fetching.

In summary, the majority of the development focused on the header components and building a user layout with role-based access control, implementing responsive design and effective user profile management. The `homeHeader.tsx` file shows a clear iterative development pattern with several commits refining the component's visual elements. The incomplete line in the final commit of `homeHeader.tsx` suggests ongoing development and integration with user data.
