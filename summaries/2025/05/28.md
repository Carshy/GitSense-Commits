# Activity Summary for 5/28/2025

## 9:42:52 AM
The log shows a single code change on May 28, 2025, at 8:54:58 AM, to `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/ccl-hrms-admin/components/reuseable/createLoan.vue`.  This file is a Vue.js component for creating loan requests.

The update significantly modifies the component's UI, adding input fields for loan type, currency, amount, and duration.  It also includes functionality to display existing loan information, calculate monthly payments, and submit a new loan request.  The component interacts with backend APIs (`/financialconfig/getFinancialConfig/`, `/payrollconfig/get/config/`, `/loan/request/requirements`, `/loan/request/new`, `/loan/request/users/`) using Axios for data fetching and submission.  The code uses Vuetify components (e.g., `v-select`, `v-text-field`, `v-snackbar`).  Error handling and user feedback mechanisms (snackbars) are implemented.  The component uses moment.js for date formatting and includes custom validation rules for input fields.  A progress indicator is shown during API calls.  The component also fetches and displays existing loan details, including total available amount, existing active loan amounts, and due amounts for each loan.  There's a significant amount of i18n (internationalization) using `$t()` for multilingual support.  Finally, the code includes gratuity calculations using a separate `getGratuityCalculations` function, likely integrating with payroll systems.
