# Activity Summary for 5/28/2025

## 9:42:52 AM
The log shows a single code change on May 28, 2025, at 8:54:58 AM, to `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/ccl-hrms-admin/components/reuseable/createLoan.vue`.  This file is a Vue.js component for creating loan requests.

The update significantly modifies the component's UI, adding input fields for loan type, currency, amount, and duration.  It also includes functionality to display existing loan information, calculate monthly payments, and submit a new loan request.  The component interacts with backend APIs (`/financialconfig/getFinancialConfig/`, `/payrollconfig/get/config/`, `/loan/request/requirements`, `/loan/request/new`, `/loan/request/users/`) using Axios for data fetching and submission.  The code uses Vuetify components (e.g., `v-select`, `v-text-field`, `v-snackbar`).  Error handling and user feedback mechanisms (snackbars) are implemented.  The component uses moment.js for date formatting and includes custom validation rules for input fields.  A progress indicator is shown during API calls.  The component also fetches and displays existing loan details, including total available amount, existing active loan amounts, and due amounts for each loan.  There's a significant amount of i18n (internationalization) using `$t()` for multilingual support.  Finally, the code includes gratuity calculations using a separate `getGratuityCalculations` function, likely integrating with payroll systems.


## 10:42:51 AM
The log shows updates to two Vue.js components: `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/ccl-hrms-admin/pages/index.vue` and `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/ccl-hrms-admin/components/Bell.vue`.

The `/pages/index.vue` file was updated twice on May 28, 2025, with very minor edits between 10:29:04 AM and 10:30:16 AM.  Both versions contain extensive Vue.js code for a login page, including username/password fields,  OTP verification, password reset functionality, and  handling of various views (`username`, `otp`, `createPasswordView`, `forgotPasswordView`).  The code is highly structured using Vuetify components and  internationalization (`$t`) for multi-language support.


The `/components/Bell.vue` file was updated once on May 28, 2025, at 10:35:08 AM. This component renders a notification bell that displays a count of unread notifications.  Clicking the bell opens a menu showing notifications, with options to mark all as read and view all notifications. The component uses Axios for API calls to fetch and update notification read status, Moment.js for date formatting, and Vuetify for UI elements.  The code demonstrates efficient handling of notification data, including fetching in batches and updating read status individually.


## 12:43:34 PM
The log shows modifications to two Vue.js components: `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/ccl-hrms-admin/components/EOS/calculator.vue` and `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/ccl-hrms-admin/components/reuseable/createLoan.vue`.

The `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/ccl-hrms-admin/components/EOS/calculator.vue` component underwent multiple revisions between 12:00 PM and 12:06 PM on May 28, 2025.  These revisions appear to be minor adjustments and do not show any substantial changes in functionality.  The code primarily focuses on an employee's end-of-service (EOS) benefits calculator, displaying employee information, exit details (last working day, exit status), leave information (paid and unpaid leave days), and payroll items.  The component uses Vuetify for UI elements and interacts with backend services (`services_general`) for retrieving employee data and images.  Calculations are performed within the component, particularly around leave encashment amounts, using different formulas based on work schedules and configuration settings (`selectedUserPayrollConfig`).

The `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/ccl-hrms-admin/components/reuseable/createLoan.vue` component was updated at 12:12:58 PM on May 28, 2025. This component is a reusable loan request form.  It allows users to select a loan type, enter the loan amount and duration, and provide a description. The component fetches loan types from a backend API (`fetchFinanceConfig`) and calculates monthly payments (`computedMonthlyPayment`).  It also displays information about existing loans,  validates user input, and submits the loan request to a backend endpoint (`createLoanRequest`). The component uses Vuetify components and integrates with notification and general utility plugins.  The `createLoanRequest` method handles the submission, displaying success or error messages using a snackbar.  The component also appears to interact with employee data, possibly to determine loan eligibility based on existing loan balances (`existingLoanInfo`).
