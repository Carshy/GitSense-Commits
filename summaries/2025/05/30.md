# Activity Summary for 5/30/2025

## 1:01:10 PM
The Nuxt.js configuration file (`nuxt.config.js`) was updated on May 30, 2025, at 12:17:12 PM.  The changes include modifications to environment variables, plugins, and the Axios configuration.

**Key Changes:**

* **Environment Variables:**  The `env` section now explicitly sets `NODE_ENV` (based on the process environment or defaults to "development"),  `documenturl` to `https://pdf-engine.devnhr.com/`, and `insurancePortalUrl` to `https://insurance-api-staging.devnhr.com/`.  This suggests a shift towards using environment variables for configuration.

* **Plugins:** Several plugins were added or modified, including `vue-awesome-swiper`, `vue-excel`, Google Analytics (`ga.js`), Quill Editor (`quillEditorjs.js`), Chart.js, Google Maps, ApexCharts,  vue-organization-chart, and vue-tree-chart.  Some plugins were specified for client-side only execution (`mode: 'client'`) while others were explicitly disabled for server-side rendering (`ssr: false`). The addition of many plugins suggests an expansion of the application's functionality.

* **Axios Configuration:** The `axios` module configuration was updated to use a `baseURL` and other settings (crossDomain, https) dynamically based on the `config` object and the `appEnv` variable.  This enhances the flexibility of the application to adapt to different environments.

* **Authentication:** The `auth` module is configured with a refresh token strategy using  `/users/login` and `/users/refresh-tokens` endpoints. This points to a system using JWT for authentication.

* **Internationalization:** The `i18n` module is configured to support English and Arabic languages.

* **Security Headers:** The `helmet` module is used to set several security-related HTTP headers (frameguard, dnsPrefetchControl, etc.), aiming to improve the application's security posture.

* **Webpack Configuration:** A `webpack.ProvidePlugin` is used to provide global variables for lodash and Quill.js, simplifying their usage within the application.


The overall pattern shows a move toward a more robust and feature-rich application, utilizing various plugins and configurations for security, internationalization, and authentication. The use of environment variables improves the application's adaptability to different deployments.


## 2:39:54 PM
The Nuxt.js configuration file (`nuxt.config.js`) was updated on May 30, 2025, at 1:39:22 PM.  The changes primarily involve adjustments to environment variables, plugins, and security headers.

**Key Changes:**

* **Environment Variables:** The `env` object was updated to include `NODE_ENV`, `documenturl` (pointing to `https://pdf-engine.devnhr.com/`), and `insurancePortalUrl` (pointing to `https://insurance-api-staging.devnhr.com/`).  This suggests a shift to using environment variables for configuration, likely for different deployment environments.

* **Plugins:** Several plugins were added or modified,  including those for `vue-awesome-swiper`, various chart libraries (ApexCharts, Chart.js),  a Quill editor, Google Maps integration, and a Vue organization chart. This indicates an expansion of the application's functionality, adding interactive elements and data visualization capabilities. The `axios` plugin was also configured with environment variable based settings.

* **Security Headers (Helmet):**  The `helmet` configuration was significantly expanded to include numerous security-enhancing headers (e.g., `frameguard`, `dnsPrefetchControl`, `xssFilter`), enhancing the application's security posture.

* **Authentication (`@nuxtjs/auth-next`):** The authentication module was configured using a refresh token strategy, implying session management improvements.  The configuration specifies endpoints for login, refresh token retrieval, and user data retrieval, suggesting a robust authentication system with multiple endpoints for token management.

* **Internationalization (`@nuxtjs/i18n`):**  The i18n module was set up, with support for English and Arabic languages defined.

* **Webpack Configuration:** A `webpack.ProvidePlugin` was added to make Lodash and Quill readily available throughout the application.  The `devtool` was set to `false` in the development environment.

The overall update reflects a substantial enhancement to the application's features, security, and internationalization support. The use of environment variables simplifies the configuration for different environments.


## 5:28:49 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/payfuture-hrms-admin/components/admin-central/employmentnew.vue` on May 30, 2025.  The changes primarily focus on the component's UI, specifically enhancing the employee search and filtering functionality.  There are no substantial code changes between the timestamps of 4:38 PM, 4:39 PM, and 4:47 PM and 4:48 PM. The timestamps at 4:39:28 PM and 4:39:36 PM are very close together indicating minor, possibly inconsequential adjustments. The file's content remains largely consistent across all revisions, suggesting iterative refinements rather than a complete overhaul.  The main updates seem to center around the advanced search section,  which uses Vuetify components (`v-text-field`, `v-autocomplete`, `v-chip`, `v-menu`, `v-date-picker`, etc.) to allow filtering by Employee ID, Status, Name, Email, Designation, Department, and Cost Center, along with date ranges for Date of Joining (DOJ) and Last Working Day (LWD).  The UI also displays the number of male and female employees. A download button for employee database  is also present. There's also a commented-out section related to downloading documents, suggesting possible future implementation.
