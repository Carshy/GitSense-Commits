# Activity Summary for 5/30/2025

## 1:01:10 PM
The Nuxt.js configuration file (`nuxt.config.js`) was updated on May 30, 2025, at 12:17:12 PM.  The changes include modifications to environment variables, plugins, and the Axios configuration.

**Key Changes:**

* **Environment Variables:**  The `env` section now explicitly sets `NODE_ENV` (based on the process environment or defaults to "development"),  `documenturl` to `https://pdf-engine.devnhr.com/`, and `insurancePortalUrl` to `https://insurance-api-staging.devnhr.com/`.  This suggests a shift towards using environment variables for configuration.

* **Plugins:** Several plugins were added or modified, including `vue-awesome-swiper`, `vue-excel`, Google Analytics (`ga.js`), Quill Editor (`quillEditorjs.js`), Chart.js, Google Maps, ApexCharts,  vue-organization-chart, and vue-tree-chart.  Some plugins were specified for client-side only execution (`mode: 'client'`) while others were explicitly disabled for server-side rendering (`ssr: false`). The addition of many plugins suggests an expansion of the application's functionality.

* **Axios Configuration:** The `axios` module configuration was updated to use a `baseURL` and other settings (crossDomain, https) dynamically based on the `config` object and the `appEnv` variable.  This enhances the flexibility of the application to adapt to different environments.

* **Authentication:** The `auth` module is configured with a refresh token strategy using  `/users/login` and `/users/refresh-tokens` endpoints. This points to a system using JWT for authentication.

* **Internationalization:** The `i18n` module is configured to support English and Arabic languages.

* **Security Headers:** The `helmet` module is used to set several security-related HTTP headers (frameguard, dnsPrefetchControl, etc.), aiming to improve the application's security posture.

* **Webpack Configuration:** A `webpack.ProvidePlugin` is used to provide global variables for lodash and Quill.js, simplifying their usage within the application.


The overall pattern shows a move toward a more robust and feature-rich application, utilizing various plugins and configurations for security, internationalization, and authentication. The use of environment variables improves the application's adaptability to different deployments.
