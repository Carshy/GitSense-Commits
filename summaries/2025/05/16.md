# Activity Summary for 5/16/2025

## 5:52:48 PM
The log shows the development of a Node.js application.  Initially, `index.js` used the `utils.js` module for random number generation and Celsius-to-Fahrenheit conversion (4:43:50 PM). `utils.js` contained the functions for these operations (4:44:14 PM).

The application then shifted to using a `posts.js` module to fetch and display blog post data.  There were several revisions to `posts.js` to correct the export statement (4:46:53 PM, 4:47:05 PM) and to `index.js` to correctly import and use the `getPosts` function (4:46:20 PM, 4:47:42 PM, 4:48:10 PM, 4:50:58 PM, 4:58:07 PM, 4:58:34 PM, 4:58:59 PM).  The `index.js` file underwent many iterative changes between 4:50 PM and 5:05 PM, showing the developer's trial-and-error process in correctly iterating over the fetched post data and printing specific properties.  Finally, at 5:05:28 PM, a functional version of the code was achieved which correctly iterates through the array of post objects and prints the id, title, and body of each post.  The original functionality from `utils.js` was commented out during this refactoring process.
