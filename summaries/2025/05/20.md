# Activity Summary for 5/20/2025

## 9:28:59 AM
The log shows development of a Node.js HTTP server.  Early changes (8:32 AM) focused on creating a basic HTML file (`index.html`), adding a title and header.  Around 8:33 AM, work began on a server (`server.js`), initially with incomplete import statements, and then a fully functional server utilizing `dotenv` for environment variables and handling GET requests to `/` and `/about`.

Subsequently, a second server file (`server2.js`) was created (8:38 AM). This file underwent significant iterative development, starting as a blank server and evolving to include a hardcoded array of user objects.  Between 8:39 AM and 8:43 AM, the `users` array was populated with sample user data.  Further changes (8:43 AM - 8:57 AM) focused on implementing API functionality: specifically handling GET requests to `/api/users`, returning the `users` array as a JSON response. Error handling was added at 8:57 AM to return a 404 JSON response for non-matching routes. The final change (9:00 AM) improved the error handling response by setting the `statusCode` to 404.  The `server2.js` file's evolution demonstrates a clear progression from a basic server to one capable of handling requests and returning JSON data.  The consistent use of `dotenv` shows the intention to use environment variables for configuration.
