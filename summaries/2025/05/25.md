# Activity Summary for 5/25/2025

## 6:49:12 AM
The log shows multiple edits to `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/personal/tell_media_admin/src/app/users/layout.tsx` between 6:11 AM and 6:45 AM on May 25, 2025.  The file is a React component responsible for rendering a dashboard layout with a sidebar.

The primary changes revolve around the styling and structure of the sidebar and its components.  Specifically:

* **6:17 AM:** The `next/image` component was imported, enabling the display of user profile pictures.

* **6:30 AM - 6:45 AM:**  Several incremental changes were made to the sidebar's styling. These involved adjustments to padding (`px-6 py-8`, `pr-12`, `pr-8`, `pr-6`), color (`text-gray-800` changed to `text-gray-600`),  and the addition of a `<div>` container around the header text. These modifications seem focused on improving the visual layout and potentially correcting minor spacing issues.

* **6:45 AM:**  The most significant styling change occurred. The default color of the navigation links in the sidebar (`text-gray-600`) was changed to `text-pink-600`, and a pink background (`bg-pink-50`) was added to the navigation items.  This suggests a shift in the overall color scheme of the sidebar.


The code consistently uses Tailwind CSS classes for styling and includes features like responsive design (detecting screen size and adjusting the sidebar), user authentication and role-based redirection, and user profile fetching.  The navigation items remain constant throughout the edits, indicating a stable set of menu options.
