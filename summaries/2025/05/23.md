# Activity Summary for 5/23/2025

## 11:24:19 AM
The log shows multiple edits to `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/cybergate-admin/components/admin-central/employment.vue` between 10:51 AM and 11:00 AM on May 23, 2025.  The changes primarily involve the user interface (UI) of an employee management section.

The initial version (10:51 AM) displays employee counts (All, Active, Inactive) with color-coded cards and includes an Add New User button. A search bar is also present along with male/female employee percentages. Download and other functionalities (Bulk Update Attendance Records, Expiry Documents) are included as buttons or icons.  A significant portion of the code related to employee count cards is commented out.

Subsequent commits (10:53 AM, 10:57 AM, 10:59 AM, 11:00 AM) introduce minor UI tweaks. The most notable change occurs at 10:57 AM, where a "Bulk Salary Adjustment" button is added.  Other changes involve minor adjustments to the display of employee counts and removal of commented-out sections, improving the code's clarity. The overall structure and main functionalities remain consistent across all commits, suggesting iterative UI refinements rather than fundamental code restructuring.
