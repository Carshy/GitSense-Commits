# Activity Summary for 5/23/2025

## 11:24:19 AM
The log shows multiple edits to `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/cybergate-admin/components/admin-central/employment.vue` between 10:51 AM and 11:00 AM on May 23, 2025.  The changes primarily involve the user interface (UI) of an employee management section.

The initial version (10:51 AM) displays employee counts (All, Active, Inactive) with color-coded cards and includes an Add New User button. A search bar is also present along with male/female employee percentages. Download and other functionalities (Bulk Update Attendance Records, Expiry Documents) are included as buttons or icons.  A significant portion of the code related to employee count cards is commented out.

Subsequent commits (10:53 AM, 10:57 AM, 10:59 AM, 11:00 AM) introduce minor UI tweaks. The most notable change occurs at 10:57 AM, where a "Bulk Salary Adjustment" button is added.  Other changes involve minor adjustments to the display of employee counts and removal of commented-out sections, improving the code's clarity. The overall structure and main functionalities remain consistent across all commits, suggesting iterative UI refinements rather than fundamental code restructuring.


## 12:24:19 PM
The provided log shows two nearly identical commits to `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/cybergate-admin/components/admin-central/employment.vue` at 11:45:36 AM and 11:47:56 AM on May 23, 2025.  The changes between the commits are insignificant, suggesting a possible accidental double commit or a very minor, inconsequential edit.

The component `employment.vue` is a Vue.js component that displays and manages employee data.  The code uses Vuetify for UI components.  It includes functionality for:

* **Adding new users:** A modal (`AddNew` component) is triggered by an `addUserFlag`.
* **Displaying employee statistics:**  The component shows the total number of employees, along with a breakdown of male and female employees (using conditional rendering based on `userfetch` and data from `maleCount` and `femaleCount` objects).
* **Searching employees:** A search bar allows filtering by name or tags.
* **Filtering employees:**  Although largely commented out, the code shows functionality to filter by "All," "Active," and "Inactive" employees.  A more advanced search filter is also available using the `expandFilterForm` variable, showing filtered criteria with Vuetify's `v-chip` component.
* **Bulk actions:** Buttons/icons are provided for bulk salary adjustments, bulk attendance record updates, and downloading employee data (using a `download-excel` component).
* **Displaying Expiry Documents:** Based on the `isManager` and `hideButton` flags an image for displaying expiry documents is shown.


The code extensively uses Vuetify components (`v-card`, `v-btn`, `v-img`, `v-icon`, `v-row`, `v-col`, `v-text-field`, `v-chip`, `v-tooltip`, `v-progress-circular`, `v-divider`). The style attributes are heavily inline.  There is also a commented-out section of code related to employee card display, suggesting it may be in a state of development or refactoring.  The download functionality utilizes a custom component or library (`download-excel`) for exporting data to an Excel sheet. The SVG icons used are all relative paths within the project's asset directory.
