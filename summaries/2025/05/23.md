# Activity Summary for 5/23/2025

## 11:24:19 AM
The log shows multiple edits to `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/cybergate-admin/components/admin-central/employment.vue` between 10:51 AM and 11:00 AM on May 23, 2025.  The changes primarily involve the user interface (UI) of an employee management section.

The initial version (10:51 AM) displays employee counts (All, Active, Inactive) with color-coded cards and includes an Add New User button. A search bar is also present along with male/female employee percentages. Download and other functionalities (Bulk Update Attendance Records, Expiry Documents) are included as buttons or icons.  A significant portion of the code related to employee count cards is commented out.

Subsequent commits (10:53 AM, 10:57 AM, 10:59 AM, 11:00 AM) introduce minor UI tweaks. The most notable change occurs at 10:57 AM, where a "Bulk Salary Adjustment" button is added.  Other changes involve minor adjustments to the display of employee counts and removal of commented-out sections, improving the code's clarity. The overall structure and main functionalities remain consistent across all commits, suggesting iterative UI refinements rather than fundamental code restructuring.


## 12:24:19 PM
The provided log shows two nearly identical commits to `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/cybergate-admin/components/admin-central/employment.vue` at 11:45:36 AM and 11:47:56 AM on May 23, 2025.  The changes between the commits are insignificant, suggesting a possible accidental double commit or a very minor, inconsequential edit.

The component `employment.vue` is a Vue.js component that displays and manages employee data.  The code uses Vuetify for UI components.  It includes functionality for:

* **Adding new users:** A modal (`AddNew` component) is triggered by an `addUserFlag`.
* **Displaying employee statistics:**  The component shows the total number of employees, along with a breakdown of male and female employees (using conditional rendering based on `userfetch` and data from `maleCount` and `femaleCount` objects).
* **Searching employees:** A search bar allows filtering by name or tags.
* **Filtering employees:**  Although largely commented out, the code shows functionality to filter by "All," "Active," and "Inactive" employees.  A more advanced search filter is also available using the `expandFilterForm` variable, showing filtered criteria with Vuetify's `v-chip` component.
* **Bulk actions:** Buttons/icons are provided for bulk salary adjustments, bulk attendance record updates, and downloading employee data (using a `download-excel` component).
* **Displaying Expiry Documents:** Based on the `isManager` and `hideButton` flags an image for displaying expiry documents is shown.


The code extensively uses Vuetify components (`v-card`, `v-btn`, `v-img`, `v-icon`, `v-row`, `v-col`, `v-text-field`, `v-chip`, `v-tooltip`, `v-progress-circular`, `v-divider`). The style attributes are heavily inline.  There is also a commented-out section of code related to employee card display, suggesting it may be in a state of development or refactoring.  The download functionality utilizes a custom component or library (`download-excel`) for exporting data to an Excel sheet. The SVG icons used are all relative paths within the project's asset directory.


## 12:54:51 PM
The `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/hecqatar-admin/components/reuseable/salaryAdjustmentBulk.vue` file underwent changes on May 23rd, 2025.  The primary modification between 11:59:06 AM and 12:02:18 PM was a minor update to the button text within the component.  The button previously labeled "Add Filesssss" was corrected to "Add File". The component itself is a Vue.js component for bulk uploading salary adjustments via a CSV file.  It features:

* **CSV Upload and Preview:**  Allows users to upload a CSV file, preview the data in a data table, and add or remove entries before final submission.  The preview includes user name resolution using `services_general.getUserName`.  Error handling is included for invalid employee IDs and date formats.

* **Excel Template Generation:**  The component includes a `generateExcel` function that creates and downloads an Excel template (.xlsx) for users to populate before uploading the CSV.

* **Data Processing:** The `processCSV` method uses `papaparse` to parse the uploaded CSV, handles date formatting using `moment.js`, and performs data validation.  It interacts with a backend API (`/users/payroll/req-fields/` and `/payrollConfig/get/config/`) to retrieve user data and configuration settings. The data is then prepared for submission.

* **User Interface Elements:** The component uses Vuetify components (`v-dialog`, `v-card`, `v-data-table`, `v-file-input`, `v-btn`, `v-snackbar`) for a visually appealing and interactive user experience.  Progress indicators are displayed during processing and data retrieval.

The code suggests a robust system for managing bulk salary adjustments, with built-in error handling, data validation, and a user-friendly interface.  The API calls indicate interaction with a backend system for user authentication (`$store.getters.getToken`), user data retrieval, and configuration management.

The code changes reflect the development of an API for managing salary adjustment requests.  The updates span three files: a routing file (`salary_adjustment_request.route.js`), a controller file (`salary_adjustment_request.controller.js`), and a service file (`salary_adjustment_request.service.js`).  All changes occurred on May 23, 2025, between approximately 12:27 PM and 12:38 PM.

`/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/apis/cybergate-api/src/routes/salary_adjustment_request.route.js` defines various API endpoints for handling salary adjustment requests.  These endpoints cover actions like getting all requests, creating new requests (singly and in bulk), retrieving requests based on user ID, company ID, and pay month, updating existing requests, and approving/rejecting requests.  All routes utilize a `verifyToken` middleware, suggesting authentication is required for all actions.

`/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/apis/cybergate-api/src/controllers/salary_adjustment_request.controller.js` implements the logic for each API endpoint defined in the routing file. Each controller function uses `catchAsync` for error handling and includes logging using `logger` and `loggerService` to record successful and failed operations, including detailed error messages,  to a 'slary_adjustment_requests' log category.  The responses are consistently structured with `success`, `message`, and `data` fields.

`/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/apis/cybergate-api/src/services/salary_adjustment_request.service.js` contains the core business logic.  It interacts with database models (`Requests`, `payrollConfigModel`, `User`, `PayrollProcess`, `Payitems`, `FixedSalaryLogModel`, `Notification`) to perform operations such as retrieving salary adjustment requests, creating new requests (handling approval workflows and notifications), updating requests, and calculating prorated salary adjustments. The creation of new requests involves determining approvers based on `payrollConfigModel` and sending notifications using `sendNotification`. Bulk creation of requests mirrors the single request creation process.  The `getAll` function uses MongoDB aggregation for efficient data retrieval.  A notable aspect is the prorating calculation based on the difference between old and new salaries, considering the effective date and days in the month.  The code also includes commented-out sections related to email notifications, suggesting potential future implementation.

In summary, the changes demonstrate a well-structured API implementation for managing salary adjustment requests, incorporating robust error handling, logging, and approval workflows.  The use of asynchronous operations and aggregation enhances performance.
