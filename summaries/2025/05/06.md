# Activity Summary for 5/6/2025

## 8:35:43 AM
The log shows development of a React application, likely a content management system.  The primary focus is on the `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/personal/tell_media_admin/src/components/dashboards/dashboard1.tsx` file, which represents an admin dashboard.  This file underwent several revisions between 8:07 AM and 8:08 AM on May 6th, 2025.  The changes appear minor, primarily involving the removal of the `export default` keyword from the `AdminDashboard` component declaration. The functionality remains largely unchanged; it implements authentication checks, role-based redirects, a logout function, and a visually styled sidebar navigation menu with icons for different administrative tasks (Dashboard, User Management, Content Management, System Settings).

A new file, `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/personal/tell_media_admin/src/app/page.tsx`, representing a login page, was created at 8:13:51 AM on May 6th, 2025. This login page uses a `LoginForm` component and includes basic metadata in the `<Head>` section.

The `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/personal/tell_media_admin/src/app/dashboard1/page.tsx` file also shows an almost identical implementation of the admin dashboard component as seen in the `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/personal/tell_media_admin/src/components/dashboards/dashboard1.tsx` file, appearing between 8:09 AM and 8:16 AM.  This suggests a refactoring or migration of the dashboard component to a new directory structure within the application.  The code itself remained consistent across these multiple instances.  The repeated nature of the dashboard component code across different file paths suggests a potential opportunity for code reuse or component simplification.


## 9:35:42 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/personal/tell_media_admin/src/app/dashboard1/page.tsx` between 8:37 AM and 8:47 AM on May 6, 2025.  The file is a React component for an admin dashboard.

The main changes track the evolution of the user information display in the sidebar. Initially (8:37 AM), the user's role was statically displayed as "System Admin".  A subsequent update (8:41 AM) dynamically displayed the user's role from the `user.role` property.  Another edit (8:42 AM) slightly altered the display to "System {user.role}", concatenating "System" with the role.  Finally (8:45 AM), the displayed role was capitalized using the `capitalize` CSS utility.  The last significant change (8:47 AM) replaced the username display with the user's first and last name (`user.first_name`, `user.last_name`).

Throughout the revisions, the core functionality—authentication checks, role-based redirection, and logout handling—remained consistent.  The changes primarily focused on enhancing the user interface and presentation of user data within the sidebar.


## 2:36:13 PM
The codebase shows development of Redux slices for user profile management.  The `profileSlice.ts` file underwent several revisions between 2:24 PM and 2:32 PM on May 6, 2025, primarily focusing on refining the import path of  `profile.ts`. The changes were minor and only impacted the import statement, changing from  `@/types/profile` to `../../types/profile`. The functional code within `profileSlice.ts` remained consistent throughout these revisions. This file defines reducers for fetching and updating user profiles, handling loading states, errors, and success statuses. It utilizes `createAsyncThunk` for asynchronous operations interacting with a backend API via `axiosInstance` for both fetching and updating profile data.  The `updateUserProfile` thunk handles file uploads (profile picture and cover photo).

The `profile.ts` file, updated at 2:27 PM and 2:28 PM, defines interfaces for `Profile` (containing user profile data) and `ProfileUpdateData` (for updating profile data, allowing optional fields).  No significant changes occurred to this file's content across its updates.

Finally, at 2:34 PM, `store.ts` was updated to integrate the `profileReducer` from `profileSlice.ts` into the Redux store.  This indicates the completion of integrating the profile management functionality into the application's state management system.
