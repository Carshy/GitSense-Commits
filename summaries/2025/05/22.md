# Activity Summary for 5/22/2025

## 9:33:38 AM
The log shows development on three JavaScript files within a Node.js project.

`/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/personal/nodeJS-crash-course/fsDemo.js` underwent several revisions between 8:32 AM and 8:42 AM on May 22, 2025.  Initially, the file implemented asynchronous file reading and writing using `fs.promises`.  A function `appendFiles` was added and refined over several commits to correctly append text to `text.txt`. The final version shows functions for reading, writing, and appending to a file named `text.txt`, all handled asynchronously with error catching.  The file operations were refined to handle errors correctly, ensuring that the `appendFile` function was correctly appending text to the file and including a relevant log message.

`/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/personal/nodeJS-crash-course/osDemo.js` was modified between 8:52 AM and 8:56 AM on May 22, 2025.  The changes involved progressively accessing different properties of the `os.userInfo()` object (username and home directory) and then later utilizing `os.totalmem()` and `os.freemem()` to display system memory information.  The initial attempts to access the username property were incorrect, but the code was corrected to correctly retrieve the username and home directory.

`/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/personal/nodeJS-crash-course/cryptoDemo.js` saw iterative development between 9:09 AM and 9:13 AM on May 22, 2025, focusing on using the `crypto` module. The code was incrementally developed to create a SHA256 hash.  The final versions show the successful creation and display of a SHA256 hash for two different input strings: 'Admin@123' and 'Carshy@5032%'.  There was an initial attempt to use an empty string for the algorithm which caused an error.  The subsequent iterations corrected the algorithm string and showed the process of updating the hash object and then obtaining the hexadecimal digest.
