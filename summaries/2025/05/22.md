# Activity Summary for 5/22/2025

## 9:33:38 AM
The log shows development on three JavaScript files within a Node.js project.

`/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/personal/nodeJS-crash-course/fsDemo.js` underwent several revisions between 8:32 AM and 8:42 AM on May 22, 2025.  Initially, the file implemented asynchronous file reading and writing using `fs.promises`.  A function `appendFiles` was added and refined over several commits to correctly append text to `text.txt`. The final version shows functions for reading, writing, and appending to a file named `text.txt`, all handled asynchronously with error catching.  The file operations were refined to handle errors correctly, ensuring that the `appendFile` function was correctly appending text to the file and including a relevant log message.

`/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/personal/nodeJS-crash-course/osDemo.js` was modified between 8:52 AM and 8:56 AM on May 22, 2025.  The changes involved progressively accessing different properties of the `os.userInfo()` object (username and home directory) and then later utilizing `os.totalmem()` and `os.freemem()` to display system memory information.  The initial attempts to access the username property were incorrect, but the code was corrected to correctly retrieve the username and home directory.

`/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/personal/nodeJS-crash-course/cryptoDemo.js` saw iterative development between 9:09 AM and 9:13 AM on May 22, 2025, focusing on using the `crypto` module. The code was incrementally developed to create a SHA256 hash.  The final versions show the successful creation and display of a SHA256 hash for two different input strings: 'Admin@123' and 'Carshy@5032%'.  There was an initial attempt to use an empty string for the algorithm which caused an error.  The subsequent iterations corrected the algorithm string and showed the process of updating the hash object and then obtaining the hexadecimal digest.


## 2:34:24 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/hecqatar-admin/components/team-central/requests.vue` on May 22, 2025.  All revisions between 1:58:31 PM and 2:34:12 PM appear to be minor edits with no significant changes to the overall functionality or structure of the component.  The component is a Vue.js component responsible for displaying and managing team requests.  It handles various request types including Leave, Car Purchase Assistance, Education Assistance, Furnishing Grant, Time Off Lieu, WFH, Claims, Attendance, Letters, and Salary Adjustment. Each request type uses a corresponding sub-component (e.g., `CreateLeaves`, `ClaimRequest`).  The component includes features for searching, filtering (by request type and status), and adding new requests.  There is a noticeable emphasis on employee selection using a `<v-select>` component for most request types.  The code consistently uses Vuetify components (`v-row`, `v-col`, `v-card`, `v-select`, `v-img`, etc.) for layout and UI elements.  No functional changes are observed across the revisions within the given time frame.


## 3:34:45 PM
The log shows multiple updates to `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/hecqatar-admin/components/team-central/requests.vue`  between 2:37 PM and 3:30 PM on May 22, 2025.  The changes appear to be minor adjustments and do not significantly alter the overall functionality.  All updates involve the same file and primarily consist of modifications to the template section of a Vue component responsible for displaying and managing requests.  There are no discernible patterns in the code changes beyond repeated updates to the same file within a short timeframe, suggesting iterative refinements or bug fixes rather than a major overhaul.  The component seems to handle various request types ('leave', 'claim', 'Car Purchase Assistance', 'Education Assistance', 'Furnishing Grant', 'lieu', 'wfh', 'Attendance', 'Letters', 'Salary Adjustment'), each with its own sub-component for creation or editing.  A search and filtering functionality is also present.


## 5:02:42 PM
The log shows two revisions of `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/hecqatar-admin/components/reuseable/createSalaryAdjustment.vue`,  both within a minute of each other on May 22, 2025.  The changes are minor. The second revision corrects a typo in the template section, changing "Salary Elementsssss" to "Salary Elements".  Both revisions contain Vue.js code for a component that handles salary adjustments. The component allows users to select a change type (amount or percentage), specify an effective date, and adjust different salary components.  It uses several Vuetify components (e.g., `v-card`, `v-row`, `v-select`, `v-text-field`, `v-menu`, `v-dialog`, `v-snackbar`, `v-btn`) to create a user interface for managing salary adjustments.  The code also interacts with an API (`$axios`) for fetching configuration data and checking for pending salary adjustment requests. The component includes functions for cloning data, calculating totals, and handling user input validation.  The use of `_.cloneDeep` from Lodash suggests a focus on managing data immutability. The overall purpose is to provide a user interface for creating and previewing salary adjustment requests.


## 6:50:44 PM
The log shows multiple edits to `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/personal/tell_media_admin/src/components/reusable/dashboardHeader.tsx`  between 6:08 PM and 6:47 PM on May 22, 2025.  The file is a React component rendering a dashboard header.

The initial version (6:08 PM) displays the time (in EAT), a greeting, the user's name (fetched from Redux store), temperature, and a "Quote of the Day" section including an image and a `QuoteIcon` from `lucide-react`.

Subsequent commits (6:13 PM - 6:15 PM) focused on minor UI adjustments to the quote section, primarily repositioning the `QuoteIcon` and adding/adjusting margin values (`mr-2`, `mr-5`, `mr-8`, `mr-14`) to improve spacing and layout.  These were quick iterative changes to the styling.

Between 6:15 PM and 6:31 PM, additional styling refinements continued, mainly impacting the Quote section's layout.  The changes involved wrapping elements within additional divs (`<div>`) to control the layout of the quote and icon, making the quote and icon arrangement more organized. The quote text size was also reduced from `text-2xl` to `text-lg` (6:30 PM, 6:31 PM).

The last significant change (6:42 PM - 6:47 PM) adjusted the greeting logic, changing the "Good Afternoon" cutoff from 6 PM to 4 PM, and modified the styling of the user's name to a smaller size (`font-size: 25px;`) and a slightly grayer color (`color: #8C9CAC;`).  The `font-weight` property for the names was also changed to `font-weight-thin`.  These changes suggest a focus on both functional and visual improvements to the component.  The overall pattern is iterative UI refinement with a later change in the logic of the greeting.
