# Activity Summary for 5/27/2025

## 10:07:06 AM
The log shows two revisions of `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/ccl-hrms-admin/components/reuseable/createLoan.vue`, a Vue.js component for creating loan requests.  Both revisions are nearly identical, with the only noticeable difference being a console log statement added to the `totalAvailbleAmount` computed property in the second revision (timestamp 5/27/2025, 9:57:16 AM). This log statement prints the `existingLoanInfo` array, seemingly for debugging purposes.  The component handles loan application, fetching loan types, requirements, and user payroll configurations via API calls (`$axios`). It uses Vuetify components for UI elements and includes validation rules and progress indicators. The core functionality—creating and submitting loan requests—remains unchanged between revisions.  The added console log suggests a minor debugging or logging update in the second revision.

The provided log shows two revisions of `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/ccl-hrms-admin/components/reuseable/createLoan.vue`, a Vue.js component for creating loan requests.  Both revisions are nearly identical, suggesting only minor, inconsequential changes were made between 10:17:03 AM and 10:32:19 AM on May 27, 2025. The component handles loan application forms, fetching loan types and requirements from backend APIs (`/financialconfig/getFinancialConfig/`, `/loan/request/requirements`, `/loan/request/new`), and displaying existing loan information.  The `createLoanRequest` method submits the loan application, incorporating a progress indicator and feedback mechanism using a snackbar.  The code extensively uses Vuetify components (`v-progress-linear`, `v-row`, `v-col`, `v-form`, `v-select`, `v-text-field`, `v-textarea`, `v-btn`, `v-snackbar`, `v-progress-circular`, `v-card`) and interacts with a backend via Axios for API calls, using authentication tokens (`Authorization: Bearer ...`).  There's also integration with a moment.js library for date handling and a custom notification plugin. No substantial functional changes are apparent between the two recorded versions.
