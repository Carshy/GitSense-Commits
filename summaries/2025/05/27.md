# Activity Summary for 5/27/2025

## 10:07:06 AM
The log shows two revisions of `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/ccl-hrms-admin/components/reuseable/createLoan.vue`, a Vue.js component for creating loan requests.  Both revisions are nearly identical, with the only noticeable difference being a console log statement added to the `totalAvailbleAmount` computed property in the second revision (timestamp 5/27/2025, 9:57:16 AM). This log statement prints the `existingLoanInfo` array, seemingly for debugging purposes.  The component handles loan application, fetching loan types, requirements, and user payroll configurations via API calls (`$axios`). It uses Vuetify components for UI elements and includes validation rules and progress indicators. The core functionality—creating and submitting loan requests—remains unchanged between revisions.  The added console log suggests a minor debugging or logging update in the second revision.


## 11:07:07 AM
The provided log shows two revisions of `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/ccl-hrms-admin/components/reuseable/createLoan.vue`, a Vue.js component for creating loan requests.  Both revisions are nearly identical, suggesting only minor, inconsequential changes were made between 10:17:03 AM and 10:32:19 AM on May 27, 2025. The component handles loan application forms, fetching loan types and requirements from backend APIs (`/financialconfig/getFinancialConfig/`, `/loan/request/requirements`, `/loan/request/new`), and displaying existing loan information.  The `createLoanRequest` method submits the loan application, incorporating a progress indicator and feedback mechanism using a snackbar.  The code extensively uses Vuetify components (`v-progress-linear`, `v-row`, `v-col`, `v-form`, `v-select`, `v-text-field`, `v-textarea`, `v-btn`, `v-snackbar`, `v-progress-circular`, `v-card`) and interacts with a backend via Axios for API calls, using authentication tokens (`Authorization: Bearer ...`).  There's also integration with a moment.js library for date handling and a custom notification plugin. No substantial functional changes are apparent between the two recorded versions.


## 2:08:12 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/ccl-hrms-admin/components/reuseable/createLoan.vue` and one revision of `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/ccl-hrms-admin/plugins/gratuity.js`.

The `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/ccl-hrms-admin/plugins/gratuity.js` file, updated at 1:31:05 PM on 5/27/2025, contains a function `getGratuityCalculations` that calculates gratuity amounts based on various factors like country, calculation type, service years, and unpaid leave days.  It handles calculations for UAE and KSA, offering different formulas based on the employee's tenure.

The `createLoan.vue` component underwent several modifications between 1:26:54 PM and 1:55:29 PM on 5/27/2025.  These changes primarily focused on refining the loan request form.  The initial version (1:26:54 PM) displays fields for loan type, currency, amount, and duration, along with information about existing loans if any.  Subsequent updates (1:32:33 PM, 1:33:37 PM, 1:46:25 PM, and 1:55:29 PM) involved minor UI tweaks and adjustments to the data handling.  A notable change is the import of the `gratuity` plugin in the final version (1:55:29 PM). There is also added functionality to display existing active loans and total amount due for those loans.  The `createLoanRequest` method handles submitting the loan application, including error handling and success messages.  The code uses `$axios` for API calls, `moment.js` for date manipulation, and Vue.js components (`v-form`, `v-select`, `v-text-field`, `v-snackbar`, etc.).  The final version removes the `gratuityCal` property from the data method and imports `getGratuityCalculations` from the `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/ccl-hrms-admin/plugins/gratuity` file.  The changes consistently use `$t()` for internationalization, suggesting a multilingual application.  The code also extensively uses error handling mechanisms throughout the API calls.
