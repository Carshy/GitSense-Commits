# Activity Summary for 5/27/2025

## 10:07:06 AM
The log shows two revisions of `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/ccl-hrms-admin/components/reuseable/createLoan.vue`, a Vue.js component for creating loan requests.  Both revisions are nearly identical, with the only noticeable difference being a console log statement added to the `totalAvailbleAmount` computed property in the second revision (timestamp 5/27/2025, 9:57:16 AM). This log statement prints the `existingLoanInfo` array, seemingly for debugging purposes.  The component handles loan application, fetching loan types, requirements, and user payroll configurations via API calls (`$axios`). It uses Vuetify components for UI elements and includes validation rules and progress indicators. The core functionality—creating and submitting loan requests—remains unchanged between revisions.  The added console log suggests a minor debugging or logging update in the second revision.
