# Activity Summary for 5/14/2025

## 10:06:54 AM
The `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/cybergate-admin/pages/payslips/index.vue` file was updated on 5/14/2025, 9:49:31 AM.  This update significantly revised the Vue.js component responsible for displaying and managing payslips.  The changes introduce a user interface for selecting companies, viewing payslips in employee-wise or month-wise views, searching for employees, and downloading or emailing payslips individually or in bulk.

Key features added include:

* **Company selection:** An autocomplete field allows users to choose a company to filter payslips.
* **Employee-wise view:** Displays a list of employees with their details, allowing selection for individual payslip viewing.  Includes image display, search functionality and pagination for large lists.
* **Month-wise view:** Presents a list of processed payroll months, enabling the selection of a specific month for viewing consolidated payslips.  Includes count of employees processed within a given month.
* **Payslip preview:** A dedicated section for viewing payslip details in a preview format.  Utilizes a `PreviewDocument` component (presumably rendering a template).
* **Download functionality:** Provides options for downloading individual and consolidated payslips as PDFs.
* **Email functionality:** Allows sending payslips via email, both individually and in bulk (with confirmation dialogs).
* **Loading indicators:**  Includes visual cues during data loading and PDF generation.

The code uses Vuetify components extensively for UI elements (e.g., `v-row`, `v-col`, `v-card`, `v-list`, `v-autocomplete`, `v-btn`, `v-dialog`, `v-snackbar`, `v-icon`, `v-img`, `v-progress-linear`),  and leverages external plugins (`general`, `emails`, `moment`) for various functionalities such as date formatting, image handling and email sending.  The component also imports custom components (`PayslipTemplate`, `Payslip`).  The structure suggests a well-organized and feature-rich payslip management system.

The log shows two entries for the file `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/apis/cybergate-api/src/controllers/payslips.controller.js`, both on May 14, 2025.  The timestamps differ by only a few seconds (10:30:56 AM and 10:31:03 AM), indicating minor, likely inconsequential, changes between the versions. The code itself appears identical in both entries.  The file contains functions for handling payslip-related actions: creating payslips, retrieving payslips by ID, month, month and company, and a consolidated version of the latter, getting payslip URLs, and sending emails. Each function includes robust error handling and logging using `catchAsync`, `logger`, and `loggerService` to record both successful and failed operations, including relevant user and request data.  A consistent pattern is the use of  `catchAsync` for error handling and logging of all actions performed.
