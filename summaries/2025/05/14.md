# Activity Summary for 5/14/2025

## 10:06:54 AM
The `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/cybergate-admin/pages/payslips/index.vue` file was updated on 5/14/2025, 9:49:31 AM.  This update significantly revised the Vue.js component responsible for displaying and managing payslips.  The changes introduce a user interface for selecting companies, viewing payslips in employee-wise or month-wise views, searching for employees, and downloading or emailing payslips individually or in bulk.

Key features added include:

* **Company selection:** An autocomplete field allows users to choose a company to filter payslips.
* **Employee-wise view:** Displays a list of employees with their details, allowing selection for individual payslip viewing.  Includes image display, search functionality and pagination for large lists.
* **Month-wise view:** Presents a list of processed payroll months, enabling the selection of a specific month for viewing consolidated payslips.  Includes count of employees processed within a given month.
* **Payslip preview:** A dedicated section for viewing payslip details in a preview format.  Utilizes a `PreviewDocument` component (presumably rendering a template).
* **Download functionality:** Provides options for downloading individual and consolidated payslips as PDFs.
* **Email functionality:** Allows sending payslips via email, both individually and in bulk (with confirmation dialogs).
* **Loading indicators:**  Includes visual cues during data loading and PDF generation.

The code uses Vuetify components extensively for UI elements (e.g., `v-row`, `v-col`, `v-card`, `v-list`, `v-autocomplete`, `v-btn`, `v-dialog`, `v-snackbar`, `v-icon`, `v-img`, `v-progress-linear`),  and leverages external plugins (`general`, `emails`, `moment`) for various functionalities such as date formatting, image handling and email sending.  The component also imports custom components (`PayslipTemplate`, `Payslip`).  The structure suggests a well-organized and feature-rich payslip management system.

The log shows two entries for the file `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/apis/cybergate-api/src/controllers/payslips.controller.js`, both on May 14, 2025.  The timestamps differ by only a few seconds (10:30:56 AM and 10:31:03 AM), indicating minor, likely inconsequential, changes between the versions. The code itself appears identical in both entries.  The file contains functions for handling payslip-related actions: creating payslips, retrieving payslips by ID, month, month and company, and a consolidated version of the latter, getting payslip URLs, and sending emails. Each function includes robust error handling and logging using `catchAsync`, `logger`, and `loggerService` to record both successful and failed operations, including relevant user and request data.  A consistent pattern is the use of  `catchAsync` for error handling and logging of all actions performed.

The Nuxt.js configuration file (`nuxt.config.js`) underwent changes on May 14, 2025, at 12:33:46 PM.  The update primarily involved modifications to the environment variables, base URLs, and plugin configurations.

Specific changes include:

* **Environment Variables:**  The `env` object was updated to include  `documenturl` pointing to  `https://pdf-engine.devnhr.com/` and `insurancePortalUrl` pointing to `https://insurance-api-staging.devnhr.com/`.  The `NODE_ENV` variable is dynamically set based on the environment.

* **Base URLs:** The `publicRuntimeConfig` now contains multiple base URLs (`atsStagingBaseUrl`, `atsProdBaseUrl`, `atsPreprodBaseUrl`) all pointing to `https://eathosatsadmin.nathanerp.com/requests/new`.  The `axios` module's `baseURL` is dynamically set using the `config[appEnv].baseUrl`.

* **Plugins:** Several plugins were added or modified, notably those related to charts (ApexCharts, Chart.js), Google Maps, a Quill editor, and Vue components (vue-awesome-swiper, vue-excel, vue-organization-chart, vue-tree-chart). The loading indicator was configured with a specific color, height, and duration.

* **Authentication:** The `auth` module is configured for a refresh token strategy using JWT tokens, specifying endpoints for login and refresh.

* **Internationalization (i18n):** The `i18n` module is configured with English and Arabic locales, using a 'no_prefix' strategy.

* **Security Headers (Helmet):**  Various security headers are enabled through the `helmet` module, enhancing security by default.

* **Webpack Configuration:**  A webpack `ProvidePlugin` is used to provide global access to lodash and Quill.js.  The `devtool` is disabled in production.

The changes suggest an update to the application's backend integration, incorporating new APIs and enhanced UI elements, along with improvements to security and internationalization.  The use of multiple base URLs implies a setup for different environments (staging, production, pre-production).

The `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/apis/hecqatar-api/src/services/loan_request.service.js` file, updated on 5/14/2025 at 2:12:33 PM, contains three primary functions: `createLoanRequest`, `approveLoanRequest`, and `withdrawLoanRequest`.  All three heavily utilize the `Requests`, `User`, and `Companies` models, along with helper functions for email (`LoanEmail`, `sendEmail`) and notifications (`NotificationHelper`, `sendNotification`).

**`createLoanRequest`**: This function handles the creation of new loan requests.  It validates user and manager existence, determines the approval flow based on the user's `loan_type` and `approvals` data, ensures unique approvers within each approval level, creates a new loan request record, and sends email notifications to relevant approvers and the applicant.  A key aspect is the processing of unique approvers at different levels, adjusting required approvals according to any duplicates.  It also includes logic for handling EOSB loans, updating applicant's `eosb_loans` field and calling a `createPayitemsEOSBLoan` function.

**`approveLoanRequest`**:  This function manages the approval of loan requests.  It verifies user and request existence, updates the request status based on approver type (admin or manager), sends email notifications based on the approval outcome, updates the applicant's `eosb_loans` if applicable (EOSB loan type), and includes a `TODO` for creating pay items.  It also handles attachment management (`approver_attachment`, `hide_attachment`).

**`withdrawLoanRequest`**: This function allows for withdrawing loan requests. It updates the request's status to "Withdrawn," updates approval statuses, adds a log entry, and appears to not include email notifications.

Recurring elements include extensive error handling returning `{ success: false, message: ..., data: [] }`, the use of `ObjectId` from MongoDB, and reliance on helper functions for email and notification management.  The code shows a strong emphasis on managing approvals and workflows, particularly for different loan types like EOSB loans, which have specific post-approval actions.  The use of `moment-timezone` suggests the system is designed to handle time zones correctly.
