# Activity Summary for 5/5/2025

## 12:36:47 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/personal/tell_media_admin/src/components/auth/LoginForm.tsx`, a React component for a login form.  All revisions maintain the core functionality: a login form that submits user credentials (username and password) via Redux's `login` action, handles loading states, displays error messages from Redux, and redirects users to `/dashboard1` upon successful login.  There's also a link to a registration page.

The key changes across revisions are primarily stylistic:

* **Between 12:16:18 PM and 12:22:47 PM:**  A minor structural change occurred in the error display section.  The `div` with class `bg-white py-8 px-4` had its `py-8 px-4` styling moved from the outer `div` to the inner one directly containing the error message. This likely improved the layout of the error message within the form.

* **Between 12:22:47 PM and 12:25:00 PM:** The background styling `bg-[#f4f7f7] from-pink-50 to-pink-100` was removed from the main `div`. This suggests a simplification or change in the desired background appearance for the login form. The form maintained its `bg-white` background.


Throughout all revisions, the component consistently uses Tailwind CSS for styling, interacts with Redux for state management, and utilizes Next.js's `useRouter` hook for navigation. The structure and functionality remained largely consistent, focusing solely on UI adjustments.


## 3:45:07 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/personal/tell_media_admin/src/components/auth/LoginForm.tsx` between 3:03 PM and 3:18 PM on May 5th, 2025.  These revisions primarily focus on refining the UI styling of a React login form using Tailwind CSS.  Changes include adjustments to the overall layout (`div` classes), specifically targeting padding, margins, background color, and the positioning of elements within the form.  There's no functional change to the form's submission or Redux interaction logic; only the visual presentation is altered across these commits.


A separate change was made to  `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/personal/tell_media_admin/src/redux/slices/authSlice.ts` at 3:42:27 PM on May 5th, 2025. This revision introduces a Redux slice for authentication management. It defines types for users, authentication state, login credentials, and login responses.  A crucial aspect is the `login` async thunk, which handles API calls to `/users/login/`, securely stores access and refresh tokens in localStorage upon successful login, and manages loading and error states.  Reducers for logout and error clearing are also included.
