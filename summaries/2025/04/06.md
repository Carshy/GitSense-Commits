# Activity Summary for 4/6/2025

## 9:15:33 AM
The log shows modifications to two files: `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/personal/tell_a_tale_spot/tell_tales/tale_a_tale/views.py` and `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/personal/tell_a_tale_spot/tell_tales/tell_tales/urls.py`.

The `views.py` file underwent multiple revisions between 8:15 AM and 8:19 AM on April 6th, 2025.  These revisions did not change the code content; the file's content remained identical across all three timestamps.  The file defines Django REST Framework viewsets for `Post` and `Category` models.  Key features include:  detailed filtering capabilities for the `PostViewSet` (search, status, category, author),  a custom action (`change_status`) to manage post status with role-based access control, and a separate action (`my_posts`) to retrieve posts created by the currently authenticated user.

The `urls.py` file was modified twice, at 8:30 AM and 8:36 AM on April 6th, 2025.  The only difference between these two versions is a single character change in the path for posts: the initial version used `/posts/` while the latter used `/post/`. Both versions include URL routing for posts (using `tale_a_tale.urls`), users (using `users.urls`), and the Django admin interface.  The `urlpatterns` also includes a conditional block for serving static media files during development.
