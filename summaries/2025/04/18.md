# Activity Summary for 4/18/2025

## 10:52:46 AM
The log shows development of a login page for a "Media CMS".

The `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/personal/tell_media_admin/src/app/page.tsx` file was modified twice.  The first version (9:58:47 AM) displayed a simple "Welcome to NEXT JS Collins" message. The second version (10:41:59 AM) completely changed the page to display a login form by importing and rendering a `LoginForm` component and adding a `<Head>` tag with metadata for SEO.


The `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/personal/tell_media_admin/src/components/auth/LoginForm.tsx` component underwent two revisions. The first version (10:47:34 AM) contained a fully functional React login form which uses Redux for state management (`useAppDispatch`, `useAppSelector`), handles username and password input, submits login requests, shows an error message, and includes a link to a registration page.  The second version (10:50:19 AM) is nearly identical to the first except for the addition of  `'use client';` at the top, indicating a change to the React rendering context.  This suggests a switch to the new React 18 client components feature in Next.js.

The overall pattern shows a rapid development iteration, building a login page from a simple welcome message to a fully styled and functional component within a short time frame (approximately 1 hour). The use of Tailwind CSS for styling is evident throughout the `LoginForm` component.
