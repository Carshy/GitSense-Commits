# Activity Summary for 4/24/2025

## 8:46:21 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/binhendi-mcs-admin/pages/payroll/_id.vue`, a Vue.js component seemingly responsible for displaying and managing payroll information.  All changes occurred on April 24th, 2025.  The core functionality remains consistent across all revisions, focusing on presenting a data table of payroll processes.

The updates appear to be minor iterative refinements rather than substantial structural changes.  The timestamps indicate a period of active development between 8:04 AM and 8:43 AM.  The code itself heavily utilizes the Vuetify framework, evidenced by components like `<v-card>`, `<v-row>`, `<v-col>`, `<v-data-table>`, `<v-btn>`, `<v-img>`, and `<v-tooltip>`.  The component displays payroll sheets, allowing actions such as generating supplementary payrolls,  viewing approval requests, withholding salaries, submitting for approval, approving/rejecting requests, downloading SIF files, viewing logs, closing sheets, and adding comments.  The conditional rendering based on `item.status`, `item.type`, `item.submit_for_approval`, and `isAdminRole` is extensive, suggesting a complex workflow with various user roles and payroll statuses.  There's no clear pattern of significant code additions or deletions; instead, there are subtle adjustments, possibly focused on improving UI elements or refining conditional logic.  The repeated nature of the code suggests incremental improvements or bug fixes.


## 9:46:20 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/binhendi-mcs-admin/pages/payroll/_id.vue` between 9:08 AM and 9:45 AM on April 24, 2025.  The file is a Vue component likely responsible for displaying and managing payroll information.  The changes appear to be minor iterative adjustments rather than substantial structural alterations.  All revisions involve the same core structure: a Vue template displaying payroll data in a `v-data-table`  with actions for generating supplementary payroll, viewing approval requests, withholding salaries, submitting for approval, approving/rejecting, downloading SIF files, viewing logs, and adding comments.  The repeated nature of the code suggests debugging or minor UI refinements.  There are no significant changes in the overall functionality of the component across these revisions.


## 10:46:24 AM
The log shows multiple updates to the `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/binhendi-mcs-admin/pages/payroll/_id.vue` file between 9:47 AM and 10:38 AM on April 24, 2025.  The changes appear to be minor edits and refinements within the Vue.js component, primarily focused on the `item.actions` section of a `v-data-table`.  This section renders actions for each payroll sheet item, such as "Add New Payitem," "Approval Requests," "Withhold Employee's Salary," "Submit For Approval," "Approve," "Reject," "Download SIF," and "Logs."  There are also actions to view comments and edit employees for supplementary payroll sheets. The core functionality remains unchanged across all revisions; the edits mainly involve adjusting conditional rendering logic using `v-if` and `v-else-if` directives and styling with additional classes and inline styles.  No significant structural changes to the component are observed. The timestamps suggest a period of iterative development and bug fixing or minor feature additions within a short time frame.


## 11:46:20 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/binhendi-mcs-admin/pages/payroll/_id.vue` on April 24, 2025.  All revisions heavily modify the template section of a Vue.js component, focusing on a data table displaying payroll processes.  No substantial changes are observed across the revisions; the modifications appear to be minor adjustments and refinements.  The timestamps indicate a period of active development between 10:54 AM and 11:38 AM. The code consistently displays a data table (`v-data-table`) with actions for each payroll run, including buttons for adding new pay items (`AddNewPayitem`, `AddNewPayitemOffCycle`), approval handling, salary withholding, downloading SIF files, viewing logs (`handleLogsDialog`), and accessing comments.  The component handles both monthly and supplementary payroll cycles, with distinct actions for each.  The repetitive nature of the changes suggests debugging or iterative improvements to the user interface and functionality rather than fundamental restructuring.


## 1:50:20 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of the `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/hecqatar-admin/pages/bulk-upload-salary/index.vue` file between 1:25 PM and 1:44 PM on April 24, 2025.  The primary change across all revisions is a correction in the `<v-card-title>` component within the template;  "Bulk Upload Salary Sheetssss" was shortened to "Bulk Upload Salary Sheet".  No functional changes are observed in the provided code snippets; the structure and functionality of the component remain consistent across all updates.  The script section, dealing with data fetching and handling, remains unchanged in the provided excerpts. The timestamps suggest a short period of iterative edits focusing on minor UI text adjustments.


## 3:42:58 PM
The provided log shows two nearly identical commits to `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/ilf-admin/components/admin-central/employment-config.vue` within a minute of each other (2:53:03 PM and 2:53:48 PM on 4/24/2025).  The changes are minimal and don't appear to alter the functionality of the component.  The code primarily involves a Vue.js component rendering employee data,  including features for adding new users (currently deactivated via `v-if="false"`), filtering, searching, and displaying summary statistics (male/female employee counts). The component utilizes Vuetify for UI elements and includes interactive charts and buttons for various actions like downloading data in XLSX format, sending emails, and adjusting salaries.  The second commit is virtually a duplicate of the first, suggesting a possible accidental double commit or a very minor, inconsequential revision.


## 3:47:56 PM
The log shows significant updates to the `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/apis/hecqatar-api` project on April 24, 2025.  The main focus is on the development of API routes related to salary adjustment requests.

At 3:34:20 PM, the `/src/routes/index.js` file was updated. This commit involved a massive update to the routing configuration, adding numerous new routes related to various features such as payroll, leave management, SSO integration (Google and Microsoft), attendance, requests, onboarding/offboarding processes, notifications, reporting, performance management, assets, and many more. The file now manages a large number of routes, indicating a substantial application.  Many routes seem to be grouped by functional area, suggesting a modular design.


At 3:41:15 PM, the `/src/routes/salary_adjustment_request.route.js` file was updated. This file defines API routes specifically for handling salary adjustment requests. It uses middleware (`verifyToken`) for authentication.  The routes support various actions: creating single and multiple requests, updating existing requests, fetching requests by different criteria (user ID, company ID, pay month), and handling approvals and rejections.

Finally, at 3:46:39 PM,  `/src/controllers/salary_adjustment_request.controller.js` was updated. This file contains the controller logic for handling salary adjustment requests. Each function (e.g., `getAll`, `createNewSalaryAdjustmentRequest`, `updateOnId`) corresponds to a route defined in the `salary_adjustment_request.route.js` file. A notable pattern is the consistent use of `catchAsync`, `logger`, and `loggerService` for error handling and logging. All controller functions log both successful and failed operations with detailed messages and error information.  The logging consistently uses 'slary_adjustment_requests' (note the typo) as the log category and includes the requesting user ID.


## 3:50:25 PM
The log shows multiple updates to `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/hecqatar-admin/components/admin-central/employment.vue` between 3:00:25 PM and 3:17:23 PM on April 24, 2025.  These changes primarily involve additions to the user interface, specifically adding a "Bulk Salary Adjustment" feature.  Initially, the file lacked this feature.  The updates between 3:03:07 PM and 3:09:15 PM seem to be minor edits and possibly auto-formatting changes as there are no substantial structural differences in the code within those timestamps. The most significant change occurred around 3:16:18 PM with the inclusion of the new functionality.  This new feature, accessible through a button displaying an upload icon, opens a modal for bulk salary adjustments via CSV upload.

A new component, `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/hecqatar-admin/components/reuseable/salaryAdjustmentBulk.vue`, is introduced at 3:21:05 PM. This component handles the CSV upload, preview, and processing for bulk salary adjustments.  It includes features for data validation, error handling, and user interaction to confirm before uploading.  The component uses `papaparse` for CSV parsing, `moment` for date formatting, and `ExcelJS` for Excel file generation. The component also fetches user data to verify employee IDs from the CSV.


## 4:47:57 PM
The log shows multiple updates to the `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/apis/hecqatar-api/src/services/salary_adjustment_request.service.js` file and the `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/apis/hecqatar-api/src/routes/salary_adjustment_request.route.js` file between 3:49 PM and 4:46 PM on April 24, 2025.

The `salary_adjustment_request.service.js` file underwent several revisions, primarily focusing on refining the service functions for managing salary adjustment requests. No significant functional changes are apparent across revisions; rather, it seems to be mostly about code cleanup and minor adjustments.  The most notable change is the addition of `NotificationLogsModel` to the import statements in the final version at 4:46:49 PM.

The `salary_adjustment_request.route.js` file shows no code changes between the different timestamps.  The file defines various Express.js routes for handling salary adjustment requests, including CRUD operations (create, read, update), filtering by user ID, company ID, pay month, and retrieving request counts. All routes use the `verifyToken` middleware suggesting authentication is required for accessing these endpoints.  The addition of `/add-item-many` endpoint for bulk creation and further endpoints for approval and rejection actions are also present.  The multiple timestamps for this file likely represent multiple saves without actual code changes.


## 5:47:57 PM
The code changes primarily involve the `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/apis/hecqatar-api/src/services/salary_adjustment_request.service.js` file, undergoing multiple revisions between 4:48 PM and 5:04 PM on April 24, 2025.  These revisions appear to be iterative refinements, with no substantial structural changes to the code's overall functionality. The service file manages salary adjustment requests, offering functionalities such as creating new requests, retrieving requests based on various criteria (user ID, company ID, pay month, status), updating requests, and retrieving counts of requests based on status.  The `createNewSalaryAdjustmentRequest` function is noteworthy, handling the creation of new requests, including calculating prorated amounts and managing an approval workflow.  There's also a commented-out section suggesting email notification functionality that may be implemented later.

The `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/apis/hecqatar-api/src/controllers/salary_adjustment_request.controller.js` file, updated at 5:05 PM on April 24, 2025, provides the API endpoints for interacting with the salary adjustment request service.  Each controller function wraps a corresponding service function using `catchAsync` for error handling, and includes logging using `loggerService` to record both successful operations and errors.  The controller handles GET and POST requests for creating, retrieving, updating and managing salary adjustments requests.  The logging appears consistently structured, recording user IDs and relevant action details for auditing.  The controller exposes endpoints for various operations, mirroring the functionality in the service layer, including functionality to get counts of requests and reject requests.


## 5:50:23 PM
The log shows updates to two Vue components on April 24, 2025.

The `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/hecqatar-admin/components/reuseable/salaryAdjustmentBulk.vue` component was updated at 5:12:40 PM.  This component handles bulk salary adjustments via CSV upload.  The changes primarily involve improvements to the user interface, adding features such as:

*   A modal for bulk uploading salary adjustments.
*   CSV file input and preview functionality.  The preview displays the parsed CSV data in a `v-data-table` allowing users to review and remove entries before uploading.
*   Error handling and feedback mechanisms are included, notifying the user about issues with the uploaded CSV (e.g., incorrect format, missing employee IDs).
*   A function `generateExcel()` creates and downloads an Excel template for the CSV upload.
*   Loading indicators (`isLoading` and `dialog_overlay`) to provide feedback during processing.
*   Backend interaction using `$axios` to fetch user data (`getUsersData`), configuration data (`getConfig`), and to eventually submit the salary adjustments.  (The final submission call is commented out).
*   The use of `papaparse` for CSV parsing and `moment.js` for date formatting.

The `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/hecqatar-admin/components/admin-central/employment.vue` component was updated at 5:22:17 PM. This component manages employee data. The update focuses on enhancing the user experience and adding functionality for:

*   An "Add New User" modal (`addUserFlag`) with components to add employees and utilizing data from the backend.
*   Improved employee filtering and searching.  Allows for searches by employee ID, name, email, designation, department, cost center, job group, team and date ranges (Date of Joining and Last Working Date).  Filtered search results are displayed using Vuetify's `v-chip` component.
*   Displaying employee count summaries (male/female employees and their percentages).  The code suggests a transition from fetching raw data counts to calculated counts from the `users` array.
*   A download functionality for employee data using the `download-excel` component. This allows for downloading the filtered and potentially modified employee database in excel format.
*   Buttons for actions such as opening a salary adjustment modal, checking fields, and viewing expiring documents.

Both updates utilize Vue.js with Vuetify for the UI, and demonstrate interaction with a backend API for data retrieval and submission.  There is a consistent use of Vuetify components (e.g., `v-dialog`, `v-card`, `v-btn`, `v-data-table`, `v-icon`) across both components.  The timestamp difference suggests the updates may be related, with the salary adjustment component potentially being used within the employee management component.
