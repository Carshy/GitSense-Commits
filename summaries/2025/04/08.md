# Activity Summary for 4/8/2025

## 8:31:59 AM
The log shows two revisions of the `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/nd-maintenance-admin/pages/payroll/_id.vue` file.  Both revisions, made within four minutes of each other (8:27:59 AM and 8:31:25 AM on 4/8/2025), contain identical code.  The code is a Vue.js component that displays a payroll sheet. It features a data table showing payroll process runs with actions for adding new pay items (monthly and supplementary), approval, rejection, download, viewing logs, and closing sheets.  Conditional rendering is heavily used based on the `item.status`, `item.type`, and `item.submit_for_approval` properties.  The component uses various Vuetify components (v-card, v-row, v-col, v-data-table, v-btn, v-img, v-tooltip, v-chip, v-badge) and includes internationalization (`$t`) for text.  No actual content changes are observable between the two commits.
