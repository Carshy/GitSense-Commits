# Activity Summary for 4/12/2025

## 4:00:32 AM
The `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/personal/tell_a_tale_spot/tell_tales/tale_a_tale/views.py` file was updated on 4/12/2025, 3:11:57 AM.  This update involves modifications to the `PostViewSet` and `CategoryViewSet` classes.

The `PostViewSet` now includes enhanced filtering capabilities within its `get_queryset` method, allowing filtering by search query, status, category, and author.  It also features a `change_status` action (POST request) to update a post's status, incorporating access control based on user roles (admin and moderator privileges for publishing).  A `my_posts` action (GET request) was added to retrieve posts authored by the currently authenticated user, with optional status filtering and pagination.  The `perform_create` method now explicitly associates posts with both a user and their profile.

The `CategoryViewSet` remains relatively unchanged, acting as a simple ModelViewSet for Category objects.  The code uses Django REST framework for building the API endpoints and includes functionalities for search, ordering, and permission handling.  There's a clear focus on providing robust filtering and access control for post management.
