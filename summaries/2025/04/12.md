# Activity Summary for 4/12/2025

## 4:00:32 AM
The `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/personal/tell_a_tale_spot/tell_tales/tale_a_tale/views.py` file was updated on 4/12/2025, 3:11:57 AM.  This update involves modifications to the `PostViewSet` and `CategoryViewSet` classes.

The `PostViewSet` now includes enhanced filtering capabilities within its `get_queryset` method, allowing filtering by search query, status, category, and author.  It also features a `change_status` action (POST request) to update a post's status, incorporating access control based on user roles (admin and moderator privileges for publishing).  A `my_posts` action (GET request) was added to retrieve posts authored by the currently authenticated user, with optional status filtering and pagination.  The `perform_create` method now explicitly associates posts with both a user and their profile.

The `CategoryViewSet` remains relatively unchanged, acting as a simple ModelViewSet for Category objects.  The code uses Django REST framework for building the API endpoints and includes functionalities for search, ordering, and permission handling.  There's a clear focus on providing robust filtering and access control for post management.

The log shows the development of a simple counter application integrated with Redux.  The changes span from 4:47 AM to 4:53 AM on April 12th, 2025.

The initial commits focus on setting up the Redux store and its integration within the React application.  `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/personal/tell_media_admin/src/redux/features/counterSlice.js` defines the counter reducer using `createSlice` from `@reduxjs/toolkit`, implementing increment and decrement actions.  The store itself is configured in `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/personal/tell_media_admin/src/redux/store/index.js`, and a custom provider (`/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/personal/tell_media_admin/src/redux/provider.js`) wraps the application to make the Redux store accessible.

The application's layout (`/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/personal/tell_media_admin/src/app/layout.tsx` and `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/personal/tell_media_admin/src/app/layout.js`) is then updated to include this provider, ensuring all components have access to the Redux store. There are two nearly identical versions of `layout.js` created, suggesting a possible minor edit that didn't significantly alter the code.

Finally, `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/personal/tell_media_admin/src/app/page.js` demonstrates the use of Redux hooks (`useDispatch` and `useSelector`) to interact with the counter, displaying the count and providing buttons to increment and decrement it.  This file shows the counter in action within the application.  The application's title and description are defined in the metadata of the layout component.

In summary, the code additions follow a logical pattern: setting up the Redux store, integrating it into the React application, and creating a simple counter interface.  There is redundancy in the creation of the `layout.js` files.  The majority of changes occur within a short timeframe, between 4:47 AM and 4:53 AM on April 12th, 2025.
