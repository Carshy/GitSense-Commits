# Activity Summary for 4/22/2025

## 11:41:30 AM
The `nuxt.config.js` file was updated on 4/22/2025 at 11:31:42 AM.  The update involved modifications to several sections:

* **Environment Variables:**  The `env` section was updated to include configuration values pulled from a `config` object based on the `NODE_ENV` variable (likely 'development' or 'production').  These settings included URLs for various services (document, insurance portal, support, notifications) and keys related to those services.


* **Plugins:** Several plugins were added or updated, including those related to:  Vue Awesome Swiper, custom filters, Vue Excel, Quill editor, Chart.js, Google Maps, ApexCharts, Vue Tree Chart, Vue Excel Editor, and Nathan Group Icons.  Some plugins were configured for client-side-only loading (`mode: 'client'`) and others had SSR (`ssr: false`) settings adjusted.

* **Modules:** The project utilizes several Nuxt.js modules, including `@nuxtjs/axios`, `@nuxtjs/proxy`, `nuxt-helmet`, `@nuxtjs/auth-next`, `@nuxtjs/i18n`, and `vue2-editor/nuxt`.  The `axios` module's configuration is dynamically loaded based on the environment variables. Notably, authentication (`@nuxtjs/auth-next`) is configured with a refresh token strategy.

* **Internationalization (i18n):** The `i18n` module is configured with English and Arabic locales.

* **Vuetify:** The Vuetify module is configured with custom variables from `~/assets/variables.scss`.

* **Build Configuration:**  Webpack configuration was extended to include a `ProvidePlugin` for loading Lodash and Quill.js globally.  The `TerserPlugin` is configured to minimize the code and remove console logs in production.  The `devtool` setting is disabled in development mode.

* **Server:** The server port is dynamically set based on values from the configuration file.

In summary, the changes reflect a comprehensive update to the Nuxt.js application configuration, encompassing environment-specific settings, plugin integration for various functionalities (UI, charts, data processing), authentication, internationalization, and optimization for production. The use of dynamic configuration based on environment variables is a key pattern observed.
