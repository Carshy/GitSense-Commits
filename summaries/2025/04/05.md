# Activity Summary for 4/5/2025

## 8:18:40 AM
The log shows modifications to `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/personal/tell_a_tale_spot/tell_tales/tale_a_tale/views.py` between 7:18 AM and 7:33 AM on April 5th, 2025.  The changes primarily focus on enhancing the `PostViewSet` class within a Django REST framework application.

Initially, the code lacked filter backends.  Between 7:18 AM and 7:21 AM, `filters.SearchFilter` and `filters.OrderingFilter` were added to enable searching and ordering of posts.  Concurrently, the `search_fields` attribute was progressively expanded from only including 'title' at 7:27 AM to also include 'content', 'excerpt', and finally 'author_username' by 7:28 AM.  Similarly, the `ordering_fields` attribute was added and expanded from an empty list at 7:28 AM to include 'created_at', 'updated_at', 'title', and finally 'views_count' by 7:29 AM.

The most significant change occurred between 7:31 AM and 7:33 AM, in the `perform_create` method. The method of retrieving a user's profile changed from `Profile.objects.get(user=user)` which could raise an exception if the profile didn't exist, to `Profile.objects.get_or_create(user=user)`, ensuring a profile is created if one doesn't already exist for a user.  All other aspects of the `PostViewSet` and `CategoryViewSet` remained consistent throughout the log entries.


## 9:18:39 AM
The log shows a single code update to `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/personal/tell_a_tale_spot/tell_tales/tale_a_tale/views.py` on 4/5/2025 at 9:17:58 AM.  This update defines two viewsets: `PostViewSet` and `CategoryViewSet`, using Django REST framework.

`PostViewSet` handles CRUD operations for `Post` models, including:

*   Filtering and ordering posts by various fields (title, content, author, creation date).
*   Search functionality using `SearchFilter` for title, content, excerpt, and author username.
*   Custom `perform_create` and `perform_update` methods to associate posts with the authenticated user and their profile.  This ensures that each post has a linked author and profile.
*   Custom queryset filtering based on a search parameter affecting title or ID.

`CategoryViewSet` handles CRUD operations for `Category` models with a simpler implementation.  It uses the default ModelViewSet behavior without custom methods.  The code uses a combination of `IsAuthenticated`, `IsAuthenticatedOrReadOnly`, and a custom `PostPermissions` class to manage access control.  The use of `Q objects` allows for more complex search queries combining multiple fields.


## 10:23:24 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/personal/tell_a_tale_spot/tell_tales/tale_a_tale/views.py`,  all within a short timeframe on April 5th, 2025.  The main focus of the changes is refining the `PostViewSet`.

Initially, the `PostViewSet` was a basic ModelViewSet with search and ordering capabilities.  Between 9:19 AM and 9:21 AM, minor modifications were made. The `perform_destroy` method was added, initially incorrectly saving the instance, then corrected to delete the instance at 9:21:14 AM.

A significant update occurred at 9:25:06 AM. The `get_queryset` method was enhanced to include filtering by `status`, `category`, and `author`, in addition to the existing search functionality. The search now uses `icontains` for all fields (`title`, `content`, `excerpt`, and `author__username`), providing a more comprehensive search. The earlier version only searched `title` and `id`.  There was a redundant `get_queryset` method at this point.

Finally, at 9:29:16 AM and 9:29:29 AM, two new actions were added to the `PostViewSet`:  `change_status`, a POST method to update a post's status with authorization checks to ensure only admins and moderators can publish posts, and `my_posts`, a GET method to retrieve posts authored by the currently logged-in user, including status filtering.  The redundant `get_queryset` method was removed in the final version.  The `CategoryViewSet` remained unchanged throughout the entire log.
