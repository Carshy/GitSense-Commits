# Activity Summary for 4/5/2025

## 8:18:40 AM
The log shows modifications to `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/personal/tell_a_tale_spot/tell_tales/tale_a_tale/views.py` between 7:18 AM and 7:33 AM on April 5th, 2025.  The changes primarily focus on enhancing the `PostViewSet` class within a Django REST framework application.

Initially, the code lacked filter backends.  Between 7:18 AM and 7:21 AM, `filters.SearchFilter` and `filters.OrderingFilter` were added to enable searching and ordering of posts.  Concurrently, the `search_fields` attribute was progressively expanded from only including 'title' at 7:27 AM to also include 'content', 'excerpt', and finally 'author_username' by 7:28 AM.  Similarly, the `ordering_fields` attribute was added and expanded from an empty list at 7:28 AM to include 'created_at', 'updated_at', 'title', and finally 'views_count' by 7:29 AM.

The most significant change occurred between 7:31 AM and 7:33 AM, in the `perform_create` method. The method of retrieving a user's profile changed from `Profile.objects.get(user=user)` which could raise an exception if the profile didn't exist, to `Profile.objects.get_or_create(user=user)`, ensuring a profile is created if one doesn't already exist for a user.  All other aspects of the `PostViewSet` and `CategoryViewSet` remained consistent throughout the log entries.
