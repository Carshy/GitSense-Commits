# Activity Summary for 4/19/2025

## 11:33:10 AM
The log shows a single code change to `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/personal/tell_media_admin/src/pages/_app.tsx` on April 19, 2025, at 11:29:57 AM.  This file is the main application component in a Next.js application. The change integrates Redux using a `<Provider>` component and wraps application components with a `ProtectedRoute` component unless the route is publicly accessible (defined in `publicRoutes` as `/login`, `/register`, and `/`). This suggests an implementation of authentication and authorization where certain pages require user login.  The code utilizes Next.js's `AppProps` and conditionally renders components based on route.
