# Activity Summary for 4/19/2025

## 11:33:10 AM
The log shows a single code change to `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/personal/tell_media_admin/src/pages/_app.tsx` on April 19, 2025, at 11:29:57 AM.  This file is the main application component in a Next.js application. The change integrates Redux using a `<Provider>` component and wraps application components with a `ProtectedRoute` component unless the route is publicly accessible (defined in `publicRoutes` as `/login`, `/register`, and `/`). This suggests an implementation of authentication and authorization where certain pages require user login.  The code utilizes Next.js's `AppProps` and conditionally renders components based on route.


## 12:33:11 PM
The log shows three consecutive edits to `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/personal/tell_media_admin/src/app/_app.tsx` on April 19, 2025, between 11:36 AM and 11:46 AM.  The code in all three entries is identical.  The changes appear to be inconsequential, possibly due to autosaves or failed attempts at editing.  There are no substantive alterations to the code's functionality, which wraps the application with a Redux provider and conditionally renders a `ProtectedRoute` component based on the current route. The `publicRoutes` array remains unchanged, defining `/login`, `/register`, and `/` as public routes.
