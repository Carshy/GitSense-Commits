# Activity Summary for 4/2/2025

## 8:51:38 AM
The `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/nd-maintenance-admin/pages/recursive/edit/_id.vue` file, updated on 4/2/2025 at 8:08:58 AM, is a Vue.js component for editing recurring payment items.  The component displays and allows (though mostly disabled in the code) modification of details such as employee name, pay period (using date pickers), earning type, category, amount, and remarks.  A key feature is the preview of the repayment schedule, shown in a data table allowing for individual installment editing.  The component includes functionality to stop recurring payments, showing a list of remaining payments before confirmation.  Success and cancellation alerts are also implemented.  Approver information is displayed in a dialog, showing each approver's name, status, date, and comments.  The component utilizes several Vuetify components (e.g., `v-select`, `v-text-field`, `v-dialog`, `v-snackbar`, `v-data-table`), moment.js for date formatting, and custom services (presumably fetched via `services_general`) for retrieving user and image data.  Much of the form fields are disabled, indicating a read-only or view-only mode for the majority of the form's functionality.  The data fetching uses axios with authentication headers, indicating the component accesses a backend API.  The component's state management includes variables for managing dialogs, alerts, form validation, and data editing.
