# Activity Summary for 4/14/2025

## 11:24:13 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/hecqatar-admin/pages/eos/index.vue` and `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/hecqatar-admin/components/EOS/calculator.vue` on April 14, 2025.

`/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/hecqatar-admin/pages/eos/index.vue` underwent several minor updates between 10:35:17 AM and 10:52:25 AM.  These changes primarily involved text adjustments within the UI, such as changing "EOS Application" to "EOS Calculator" in the heading and "Preview" to "Previewssssssss" and then back to "Preview" in a card title. A `border: 2px solid red` style was added to a `v-card` at 10:52:25 AM.  The button text "Savedddd" was changed to "Save".  The overall structure and functionality of the component remained consistent across these revisions. The file uses Vue.js components (`EOSList`, `calculatorEOS`, `eosInformation`, `EOSTemplate`, `previewEOS`) and integrates date pickers, text fields, and image elements for a user interface related to EOS applications or calculators.


`/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/hecqatar-admin/components/EOS/calculator.vue` was also modified between 10:39:56 AM and 10:42:11 AM.  The changes here primarily focused on correcting a minor typo, changing "Employee Informations" to "Employee Information" in a heading.  No major functional changes appear to have been introduced; the core structure of the employee information input form remained the same.  The component makes use of several Vue.js components like `v-autocomplete`, `v-text-field`, `v-select`, `v-menu`, and `v-date-picker` to allow users to input details for the EOS calculation.  It also fetches data from a backend API ('coreconfig/getCoreConfig' and 'users/all/') using Axios, likely to populate employee details and configurations.
