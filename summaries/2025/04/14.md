# Activity Summary for 4/14/2025

## 11:24:13 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/hecqatar-admin/pages/eos/index.vue` and `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/hecqatar-admin/components/EOS/calculator.vue` on April 14, 2025.

`/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/hecqatar-admin/pages/eos/index.vue` underwent several minor updates between 10:35:17 AM and 10:52:25 AM.  These changes primarily involved text adjustments within the UI, such as changing "EOS Application" to "EOS Calculator" in the heading and "Preview" to "Previewssssssss" and then back to "Preview" in a card title. A `border: 2px solid red` style was added to a `v-card` at 10:52:25 AM.  The button text "Savedddd" was changed to "Save".  The overall structure and functionality of the component remained consistent across these revisions. The file uses Vue.js components (`EOSList`, `calculatorEOS`, `eosInformation`, `EOSTemplate`, `previewEOS`) and integrates date pickers, text fields, and image elements for a user interface related to EOS applications or calculators.


`/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/hecqatar-admin/components/EOS/calculator.vue` was also modified between 10:39:56 AM and 10:42:11 AM.  The changes here primarily focused on correcting a minor typo, changing "Employee Informations" to "Employee Information" in a heading.  No major functional changes appear to have been introduced; the core structure of the employee information input form remained the same.  The component makes use of several Vue.js components like `v-autocomplete`, `v-text-field`, `v-select`, `v-menu`, and `v-date-picker` to allow users to input details for the EOS calculation.  It also fetches data from a backend API ('coreconfig/getCoreConfig' and 'users/all/') using Axios, likely to populate employee details and configurations.


## 12:24:10 PM
The log shows multiple edits to `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/hecqatar-admin/pages/eos/index.vue` and `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/hecqatar-admin/components/EOS/calculator.vue` between 11:29 AM and 12:21 PM on April 14, 2025.  The changes in `/pages/eos/index.vue` primarily involve minor text adjustments in the UI, specifically the "Preview" label in the card title.  There's no significant structural or functional change across these edits.


The `/components/EOS/calculator.vue` file also underwent several revisions during this period. The modifications seem focused on refining the component's functionality and user interface without major structural overhauls.  Specifically, the changes involve correcting minor typos (e.g., "Exit Statusss" to "Exit Status").  The component continues to handle employee information, exit details, leave information, and payroll items, with functions for adding and removing variable elements.  The core functionality of fetching data based on user ID and updating the UI accordingly remains consistent throughout the revisions.


## 1:24:10 PM
The log shows several updates to the `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/hecqatar-admin` project, specifically focusing on EOS (End of Service) functionalities.  The changes span from April 14th, 2025, between 12:48 PM and 1:19 PM.

`/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/hecqatar-admin/components/EOS/calculator.vue` underwent two updates within a minute of each other (12:48 PM and 12:49 PM). These updates appear to be minor and do not show any significant changes in the code's functionality. The component is a Vue.js component responsible for calculating EOS information.  It features an employee selection, date pickers for last working day and salary paid until, exit status selection, and pay item management, including additions and deductions.  The component interacts with backend services (`$axios`) to fetch employee data and core configurations.


`/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/hecqatar-admin/pages/eos/index.vue` was updated multiple times between 12:53 PM and 1:10 PM. These updates mainly involved refinements to the UI, particularly the button labels ("Saveddddd" changed back to "Save"). The page displays a list of EOS applications and includes filtering and searching capabilities.  It also allows users to switch between viewing the EOS calculator and application information.  The page utilizes several components (`calculatorEOS`, `previewEOS`, `EOSList`, `eosInformation`, `EOSTemplate`) and incorporates features for saving and submitting EOS applications.  It also shows data in a summarized view and has functionality for exporting data in excel.


`/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/hecqatar-admin/components/EOS/preview.vue` was updated once at 1:19 PM. This component displays a preview of the EOS information.  It uses data from the `eos` prop to render information about the employee's end-of-service settlement, including salary payable, leave information, additions and deductions, gratuity, and total compensation. The component uses helper functions from `~/plugins/general` for formatting data and retrieving company details.


Overall, the log indicates iterative development of an EOS application management system with a focus on UI refinement, data presentation and user interaction. The consistent use of Vue.js components and backend API calls for data retrieval shows a well-structured application architecture.  The frequent updates suggest an agile development process with rapid iteration and testing.


## 4:44:25 PM
The `nuxt.config.js` file was updated on April 14, 2025, at 4:27:09 PM.  The changes primarily involve configuration updates for a Nuxt.js application.

Specific updates include:

* **Environment Variables:** The `env` object was modified to include `NODE_ENV`, `documenturl` pointing to `https://pdf-engine.devnhr.com/`, and `insurancePortalUrl` pointing to `https://insurance-api-staging.devnhr.com/`.

* **Plugins:** Several plugins were added or modified, including `vue-awesome-swiper`, custom filters (`filters.js`), `vue-excel`, Google Analytics (`ga.js`), Quill editor (`quillEditorjs.js`), Chart.js, Google Maps, ApexCharts,  `vue-organization-chart`, and `vue-tree-chart`.  Some plugins were configured for client-side only execution (`mode: 'client'`) and some for SSR (`ssr: false`).

* **Modules:** The configuration for various Nuxt.js modules was updated, including `@nuxtjs/axios`, `@nuxtjs/dotenv`, `@nuxtjs/proxy`, `nuxt-helmet`, `@nuxtjs/auth-next`, and `@nuxtjs/i18n`.  The `axios` module was configured with environment-specific base URLs, cross-domain settings and HTTPS settings pulled from a separate `config` file. The authentication module (`@nuxtjs/auth-next`) is configured for a refresh token strategy.  The `i18n` module now includes Arabic support in addition to English.

* **Webpack Configuration:** A `webpack.ProvidePlugin` was added to provide global access to lodash and Quill.js.

* **Helmet Configuration:** Extensive Helmet configurations were added to enhance security headers.

* **Vuetify Configuration:** The Vuetify theme was customized with a primary color of `#24576a`.

* **Build Configuration:**  The `build` section includes transpiling for `xlsx`, and a development-time setting for `devtool`.


The overall changes suggest a significant update to the application's frontend, integrating various third-party libraries and services, enhancing security,  and adding internationalization support.  The use of environment variables and a separate `config` file indicates an effort towards environment-specific configurations.
