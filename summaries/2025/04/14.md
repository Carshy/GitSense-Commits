# Activity Summary for 4/14/2025

## 11:24:13 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/hecqatar-admin/pages/eos/index.vue` and `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/hecqatar-admin/components/EOS/calculator.vue` on April 14, 2025.

`/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/hecqatar-admin/pages/eos/index.vue` underwent several minor updates between 10:35:17 AM and 10:52:25 AM.  These changes primarily involved text adjustments within the UI, such as changing "EOS Application" to "EOS Calculator" in the heading and "Preview" to "Previewssssssss" and then back to "Preview" in a card title. A `border: 2px solid red` style was added to a `v-card` at 10:52:25 AM.  The button text "Savedddd" was changed to "Save".  The overall structure and functionality of the component remained consistent across these revisions. The file uses Vue.js components (`EOSList`, `calculatorEOS`, `eosInformation`, `EOSTemplate`, `previewEOS`) and integrates date pickers, text fields, and image elements for a user interface related to EOS applications or calculators.


`/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/hecqatar-admin/components/EOS/calculator.vue` was also modified between 10:39:56 AM and 10:42:11 AM.  The changes here primarily focused on correcting a minor typo, changing "Employee Informations" to "Employee Information" in a heading.  No major functional changes appear to have been introduced; the core structure of the employee information input form remained the same.  The component makes use of several Vue.js components like `v-autocomplete`, `v-text-field`, `v-select`, `v-menu`, and `v-date-picker` to allow users to input details for the EOS calculation.  It also fetches data from a backend API ('coreconfig/getCoreConfig' and 'users/all/') using Axios, likely to populate employee details and configurations.


## 12:24:10 PM
The log shows multiple edits to `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/hecqatar-admin/pages/eos/index.vue` and `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/hecqatar-admin/components/EOS/calculator.vue` between 11:29 AM and 12:21 PM on April 14, 2025.  The changes in `/pages/eos/index.vue` primarily involve minor text adjustments in the UI, specifically the "Preview" label in the card title.  There's no significant structural or functional change across these edits.


The `/components/EOS/calculator.vue` file also underwent several revisions during this period. The modifications seem focused on refining the component's functionality and user interface without major structural overhauls.  Specifically, the changes involve correcting minor typos (e.g., "Exit Statusss" to "Exit Status").  The component continues to handle employee information, exit details, leave information, and payroll items, with functions for adding and removing variable elements.  The core functionality of fetching data based on user ID and updating the UI accordingly remains consistent throughout the revisions.
