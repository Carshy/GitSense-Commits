# Activity Summary for 4/13/2025

## 8:00:47 AM
The log shows development of a login page and its integration into a Next.js application.

`/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/personal/tell_media_admin/src/app/login/page.js`  underwent several revisions between 7:42 AM and 7:51 AM, but the code remained largely consistent. This file contains a React component for a login form that uses Redux for state management and Next.js's `useRouter` for navigation.  The component handles user input, form submission, and displays loading and error states.  No functional changes are apparent in these revisions.


`/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/personal/tell_media_admin/src/app/page.js` was modified multiple times between 7:45 AM and 7:58 AM.  Initially, it was a simple page displaying a header and a message indicating Redux connectivity.  Subsequent changes involved importing and rendering the `LoginPage` component from `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/personal/tell_media_admin/src/app/login/page.js`. The import path for `LoginPage` was corrected several times, finally settling on the correct relative path `'./login/page/'` by 7:57 AM.  The final version successfully integrates the login page into the main application layout.  The primary focus of these changes was integrating the login component.
