# Activity Summary for 4/13/2025

## 8:00:47 AM
The log shows development of a login page and its integration into a Next.js application.

`/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/personal/tell_media_admin/src/app/login/page.js`  underwent several revisions between 7:42 AM and 7:51 AM, but the code remained largely consistent. This file contains a React component for a login form that uses Redux for state management and Next.js's `useRouter` for navigation.  The component handles user input, form submission, and displays loading and error states.  No functional changes are apparent in these revisions.


`/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/personal/tell_media_admin/src/app/page.js` was modified multiple times between 7:45 AM and 7:58 AM.  Initially, it was a simple page displaying a header and a message indicating Redux connectivity.  Subsequent changes involved importing and rendering the `LoginPage` component from `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/personal/tell_media_admin/src/app/login/page.js`. The import path for `LoginPage` was corrected several times, finally settling on the correct relative path `'./login/page/'` by 7:57 AM.  The final version successfully integrates the login page into the main application layout.  The primary focus of these changes was integrating the login component.


## 9:00:48 AM
The log shows extensive modifications to the `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/personal/tell_media_admin` project, primarily focusing on the styling and functionality of the login form and the main application page (`/app/page.js`).

Between 8:10 AM and 8:17 AM, the `LoginForm.js` component and the `LoginPage.js` were created and  `/app/page.js` was updated multiple times with minor adjustments to its styling (specifically, the `main` element's padding and flex properties).  These changes involved simple UI adjustments, demonstrating iterative refinements to the layout.


A significant change occurred at 8:22 AM in `/app/page.js`. This commit introduced a more complex layout for the home page, separating the branding and login form into distinct sections using flexbox. The page now includes messaging to logged-in users.


Between 8:40 AM and 8:58 AM, major styling updates were applied.  The `/app/page.js` file was substantially revised to incorporate a dark mode design with a prominent purple (#FF6CB5) accent color.  Links to "About" and "Contact" pages were added. The `LoginForm.js` component was updated to accept a `pinkColor` prop, allowing for dynamic styling based on the theme.  The input fields and buttons now use a dark theme styling.  This suggests a design overhaul transitioning to a darker color scheme.  There were several minor adjustments to the styling of the main page during this period.  The final change at 8:58 AM streamlined the conditional rendering of the LoginForm within `/app/page.js` removing unnecessary wrapping divs, improving code readability.  The primary focus in this period was the visual overhaul of the login page.  Finally,  the `LoginForm` component reverted back to its initial styling at 8:53 AM, then  the changes in styling were reapplied again shortly after.
