# Activity Summary for 4/21/2025

## 12:57:04 PM
The log shows development on a media content management system.  The most significant changes occurred between 12:52 PM and 12:55 PM on April 21, 2025.

`/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/personal/tell_media_admin/src/app/auth/login/page.tsx` (12:52 PM): This file was updated to create a login page.  It imports a `LoginForm` component and sets up basic page metadata (title and description).

`/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/personal/tell_media_admin/src/components/auth/LoginForm.tsx` (12:53 PM): This file contains a React component for user login. It uses Redux for state management (`useAppDispatch`, `useAppSelector`), handles form input changes, and submits login data using `next/navigation` for routing. The component includes styling using Tailwind CSS and displays error messages from the Redux store.  The login process includes a loading state visual indicator.

`/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/personal/tell_media_admin/src/app/dashboard1/page.tsx` (12:55 PM): This file renders the dashboard page. It utilizes Redux to check authentication (`isAuthenticated` and `user`), redirects to the login page if not authenticated,  and provides a logout button. The component displays a loading indicator if user data is not yet available and includes basic dashboard layout and styling using Tailwind CSS.  A welcome message personalized with the username is included in the header.


The recurring theme is the use of React, Redux, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS for building a user authentication and dashboard system.  The code uses functional components, hooks, and asynchronous operations for handling user interaction and data fetching.
