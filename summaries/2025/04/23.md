# Activity Summary for 4/23/2025

## 8:49:34 AM
The log shows multiple updates to `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/binhendi-admin/pages/payroll/_id.vue` between 8:24 AM and 8:33 AM on April 23, 2025.  These updates appear to be minor edits or refinements, as the core functionality remains the same across all entries.  The code within the file is a Vue.js component focused on payroll processing. It displays a data table of payroll sheets, allowing for actions like generating supplementary payrolls, viewing approval requests, withholding salaries, submitting for approval, downloading SIF files, viewing logs, and closing sheets.  Each row in the data table represents a payroll run and offers actions specific to its status ('active' or 'inactive') and type ('Monthly' or 'Supplementary').

A separate file, `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/binhendi-admin/components/datatables/salarySheetDT.vue`, was updated at 8:32:37 AM on April 23, 2025. This component is a data table for displaying salary sheets. It includes features for downloading full and variable salary sheets in XLSX format and searching within the data table.  The table dynamically generates headers based on the provided configuration (`config.fixed`, `config.earning`, `config.recurring_earning`, `config.deduction`, `config.recurring_deduction`)  and company-specific tax deductions, and highlights salary adjustments.  The `computeSalarySheetDOJ` computed property processes the data to display net annual leave payable amounts correctly.


## 8:55:21 AM
The `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/apis/binhendi-api/.env` file contains various environment variables, updated on 4/23/2025, 8:04:58 AM.  The changes involve updates to database connection strings (multiple `DATABASE_URL` entries for different environments like Production, Staging, and others), AWS credentials (`SECRET_KEY_AWS`, `SECRET_ID_AWS`, `ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_REGION`, and `BUCKET_NAME`), email settings (SendGrid API key, SMTP settings for Mailtrap),  JWT configuration parameters, URLs for various services (e.g., `CLIENT_URL`, `API_URL`, `documenturl`, `Micro_Service_Url`), client and server keys (`JWT_SECRET`, `JWT_KEY`, `SECRET_KEY`),  Microsoft Single Sign-On configurations (`OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`, `OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET`, `OAUTH_SCOPES`), internal ERP login credentials, and VAPID keys.  There's a mix of commented-out and active configurations suggesting ongoing development and deployment across multiple environments.  The presence of multiple database URLs indicates a setup for development, staging, and production environments.  The consistent use of `devnhr.com` in several URLs points to a common development domain.  Noteworthy is the update to several different database connections including  `DATABASE_URL`, `MOBILE_CENTRAL_DB`, `QUEUE_DATABASE_URL`, and `DATABASE_URL_CENTRAL`
