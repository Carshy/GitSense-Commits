# Activity Summary for 4/15/2025

## 9:45:58 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/babilou-admin/pages/eos/index.vue` and `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/babilou-admin/components/EOS/calculator.vue` between 9:03 AM and 9:40 AM on April 15, 2025.  The `/pages/eos/index.vue` file underwent two revisions, primarily focusing on the UI elements and their interactions,  specifically the display of EOS applications, calculators, and filters.  No significant functional changes are apparent in these commits.


The `/components/EOS/calculator.vue` file was revised multiple times. The majority of changes revolve around minor text modifications within the UI, specifically in the labels "Employee Informationsss," "Exit Informationssss," etc. These seem to be unintentional additions of extra "s" characters.  The core functionality of the EOS calculator component, including employee selection, date pickers, and variable element management, remains unchanged across revisions.  The component handles employee information, exit details, leave information, payroll items and allows adding/removing variable elements.  There's also the addition of a field for "unpaid leaves" in one of the later commits.


## 11:13:55 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/babilou-admin/components/EOS/calculator.vue` between 10:04 AM and 10:39 AM on April 15, 2025.  The changes primarily focus on the "Leaves Information" section.

Initially,  the code displayed both 'annual_leaves' and 'unpaid_leaves' values, but both used the same input field (`eos.request_details.leave_encashment_days`) for "No of Paid Leave Days".

Subsequent edits separated the input fields for 'annual_leaves' and 'unpaid_leaves',  with  the `v-model` for unpaid leaves correctly bound to `selectedEmployee().leaves.unpaid_leaves` in the final version.  This addresses a previous error where both leave types incorrectly shared a single input field.  Several minor edits around this time also refined the input validation methods (`validateInput`, `positiveNumberRule`, and `handleEmptyValue`).  The overall pattern suggests iterative debugging and improvement of the leave input section to ensure accurate data handling.


## 12:13:54 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/babilou-admin/components/EOS/calculator.vue` between 11:27 AM and 11:41 AM on April 15, 2025.  The core functionality remains consistent: a Vue component for calculating End of Service (EOS) information.

The major change across revisions involves the addition of a section for "Unpaid Leaves". Initially absent, this section is introduced in the second revision (11:30:19 AM) and further refined in subsequent commits (11:33:38 AM, 11:37:05 AM, 11:39:54 AM, 11:41:27 AM, and 11:41:49 AM).  This involves adding a new input field (`unpaid_leave_encashment_days`),  related validation methods (`validateUnpaidInput`, `handleEmptyUnpaidValue`), and a calculation method (`computeUnpaidLeaveAmount`) to determine the amount for unpaid leave based on the employee's basic salary.  The display also updates to show eligible unpaid leave days.  Minor formatting and potential bug fixes might also be present in the later commits.  The final commit at 11:41:49 AM shows no further structural changes to the unpaid leave section compared to the preceding commits.
