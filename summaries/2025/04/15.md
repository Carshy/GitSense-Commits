# Activity Summary for 4/15/2025

## 9:45:58 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/babilou-admin/pages/eos/index.vue` and `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/babilou-admin/components/EOS/calculator.vue` between 9:03 AM and 9:40 AM on April 15, 2025.  The `/pages/eos/index.vue` file underwent two revisions, primarily focusing on the UI elements and their interactions,  specifically the display of EOS applications, calculators, and filters.  No significant functional changes are apparent in these commits.


The `/components/EOS/calculator.vue` file was revised multiple times. The majority of changes revolve around minor text modifications within the UI, specifically in the labels "Employee Informationsss," "Exit Informationssss," etc. These seem to be unintentional additions of extra "s" characters.  The core functionality of the EOS calculator component, including employee selection, date pickers, and variable element management, remains unchanged across revisions.  The component handles employee information, exit details, leave information, payroll items and allows adding/removing variable elements.  There's also the addition of a field for "unpaid leaves" in one of the later commits.


## 11:13:55 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/babilou-admin/components/EOS/calculator.vue` between 10:04 AM and 10:39 AM on April 15, 2025.  The changes primarily focus on the "Leaves Information" section.

Initially,  the code displayed both 'annual_leaves' and 'unpaid_leaves' values, but both used the same input field (`eos.request_details.leave_encashment_days`) for "No of Paid Leave Days".

Subsequent edits separated the input fields for 'annual_leaves' and 'unpaid_leaves',  with  the `v-model` for unpaid leaves correctly bound to `selectedEmployee().leaves.unpaid_leaves` in the final version.  This addresses a previous error where both leave types incorrectly shared a single input field.  Several minor edits around this time also refined the input validation methods (`validateInput`, `positiveNumberRule`, and `handleEmptyValue`).  The overall pattern suggests iterative debugging and improvement of the leave input section to ensure accurate data handling.


## 12:13:54 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/babilou-admin/components/EOS/calculator.vue` between 11:27 AM and 11:41 AM on April 15, 2025.  The core functionality remains consistent: a Vue component for calculating End of Service (EOS) information.

The major change across revisions involves the addition of a section for "Unpaid Leaves". Initially absent, this section is introduced in the second revision (11:30:19 AM) and further refined in subsequent commits (11:33:38 AM, 11:37:05 AM, 11:39:54 AM, 11:41:27 AM, and 11:41:49 AM).  This involves adding a new input field (`unpaid_leave_encashment_days`),  related validation methods (`validateUnpaidInput`, `handleEmptyUnpaidValue`), and a calculation method (`computeUnpaidLeaveAmount`) to determine the amount for unpaid leave based on the employee's basic salary.  The display also updates to show eligible unpaid leave days.  Minor formatting and potential bug fixes might also be present in the later commits.  The final commit at 11:41:49 AM shows no further structural changes to the unpaid leave section compared to the preceding commits.


## 1:13:55 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to two files: `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/babilou-admin/components/EOS/calculator.vue` and `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/babilou-admin/plugins/gratuity.js`.  The changes span approximately an hour, between 12:50 PM and 1:11 PM on April 15, 2025.


`/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/babilou-admin/components/EOS/calculator.vue` underwent several updates.  The primary focus appears to be on enhancing the handling of unpaid leave information within the EOS (End of Service) calculator.  Specifically, the code includes additions of methods such as `validateUnpaidInput`, `computeUnpaidLeaveAmount`, and adjustments to `handleEmptyUnpaidValue`. These methods aim to ensure that unpaid leave days are correctly validated, calculated, and integrated into the total compensation computation.  There's also a notable addition of calling `getEmpGratuityCal()` within the `validateUnpaidInput` and `handleEmptyUnpaidValue` methods to trigger gratuity recalculation whenever unpaid leave days change. The `computedLeaveAmount` method is also mentioned but its full implementation isn't visible in this log.


`/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/babilou-admin/plugins/gratuity.js`  shows modifications to the `getGratuityCalculations` function.  Initially, the function lacked handling of unpaid leave days.  The updates added an `unpaid_leave_days` property to the `gratuityReport` object and incorporated this variable into the calculation of `no_of_days_current_month`, effectively subtracting unpaid leave days from the total service period for a more accurate gratuity calculation.  Furthermore, a `total_days` variable was introduced to store the total days of service before unpaid leave deduction.  This variable is then used to calculate `no_of_days_current_month` after the subtraction of `unpaidLeaveInfo.days`.  These changes happened between 12:53 PM and 1:06 PM.  The core gratuity calculation logic (based on years of service) remained consistent throughout the revisions.


## 2:13:54 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/babilou-admin/components/EOS/calculator.vue` between 1:14 PM and 1:22 PM on April 15, 2025.  The changes primarily focus on refining the component's logic and handling of user input, particularly regarding leave calculations.

The most significant change occurred between 1:17 PM and 1:18 PM, where a `watch` statement was added to the `<script>` section.  This `watch` statement monitors changes in the `unpaid_leave_encashment_days` variable.  Whenever this variable changes, the `getEmpGratuityCal()`, `computeUnpaidLeaveAmount()`, and `computeTotalCompensation()` methods are called, ensuring that changes to unpaid leave days are immediately reflected in the gratuity calculation and total compensation.  Prior versions lacked this reactive update, handling only changes to the `eos` object.

Other changes between different timestamps appear to be minor formatting edits or incomplete code snippets within the `computeUnpaidLeaveAmount()` method, as the code is truncated in the provided log.  The core functionality and structure of the component remain consistent across all revisions.  The component uses Vue.js and appears to be a form for calculating End of Service (EOS) information for employees, including input fields for employee selection, contract type, EOS type, leave days, and pay items.  The component also features date pickers and integrates with external modules like `moment`, `numbers2words`, `gratuity`, and `general` for date formatting, number-to-words conversion, gratuity calculations, and general utility functions respectively.
