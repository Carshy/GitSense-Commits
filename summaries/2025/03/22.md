# Activity Summary for 3/22/2025

## 9:55:42 AM
The log shows a series of edits to `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/personal/tell_a_tale_spot/tell_tales/users/serializers.py` between 9:11 AM and 9:29 AM on March 22, 2025.  The changes primarily focus on refining the `ProfileSerializer`.

Initially, the `ProfileSerializer` lacked a `username` field. This field was added and then improved upon by sourcing it from the related `User` model (`source='user.username'`) at approximately 9:13 AM.  Further iterations added the `email` field (sourced similarly from the `User` model) and a `full_name` field which is a `SerializerMethodField` computed from the first and last names of the associated user. This occurred around 9:15 AM.  The `full_name` field's implementation was finalized around 9:18 AM with the addition of `.strip()` to remove leading/trailing whitespace.

Between 9:20 AM and 9:25 AM,  `username`, `email`, and `full_name` fields were added to the `ProfileSerializer`'s `fields` attribute.  Simultaneously, they were also added to `read_only_fields` in order to prevent them from being altered. An `update` method was added to `ProfileSerializer` at 9:22 AM, providing a mechanism to update profile fields.  Finally, at 9:25 AM, `profile_picture_url` and `cover_photo_url` `SerializerMethodFields` were added, constructing absolute URIs for profile and cover photos if available, to facilitate image display.

The `validate_bio` method was added at 9:25 AM to add validation to the bio field, limiting its length to 1000 characters. The initial validation limited bio to 500 characters, then it was changed to 1000.  The overall pattern demonstrates incremental improvements to the serializer, focusing on data integrity, user experience, and improved data presentation through URL generation.  The `RegisterSerializer` and `LoginSerializer` remained largely unchanged throughout the process.
