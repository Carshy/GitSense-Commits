# Activity Summary for 3/22/2025

## 9:55:42 AM
The log shows a series of edits to `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/personal/tell_a_tale_spot/tell_tales/users/serializers.py` between 9:11 AM and 9:29 AM on March 22, 2025.  The changes primarily focus on refining the `ProfileSerializer`.

Initially, the `ProfileSerializer` lacked a `username` field. This field was added and then improved upon by sourcing it from the related `User` model (`source='user.username'`) at approximately 9:13 AM.  Further iterations added the `email` field (sourced similarly from the `User` model) and a `full_name` field which is a `SerializerMethodField` computed from the first and last names of the associated user. This occurred around 9:15 AM.  The `full_name` field's implementation was finalized around 9:18 AM with the addition of `.strip()` to remove leading/trailing whitespace.

Between 9:20 AM and 9:25 AM,  `username`, `email`, and `full_name` fields were added to the `ProfileSerializer`'s `fields` attribute.  Simultaneously, they were also added to `read_only_fields` in order to prevent them from being altered. An `update` method was added to `ProfileSerializer` at 9:22 AM, providing a mechanism to update profile fields.  Finally, at 9:25 AM, `profile_picture_url` and `cover_photo_url` `SerializerMethodFields` were added, constructing absolute URIs for profile and cover photos if available, to facilitate image display.

The `validate_bio` method was added at 9:25 AM to add validation to the bio field, limiting its length to 1000 characters. The initial validation limited bio to 500 characters, then it was changed to 1000.  The overall pattern demonstrates incremental improvements to the serializer, focusing on data integrity, user experience, and improved data presentation through URL generation.  The `RegisterSerializer` and `LoginSerializer` remained largely unchanged throughout the process.


## 10:58:31 AM
The log shows two entries for the file `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/personal/tell_a_tale_spot/tell_tales/users/views.py`, both at 10:02:03 AM and 10:02:55 AM on March 22, 2025.  The code in both entries is identical.  The file contains Django REST Framework code defining several viewsets:

* **`RegisterViewSet`**: Handles user registration, including a custom `create` method and actions for retrieving (`profile`), updating (`update_user`), and deleting (`delete_user`) users.  Access control is implemented using `permission_classes`, restricting certain actions to authenticated and/or admin users.

* **`LoginView`**: A simple view extending `TokenObtainPairView` for user login using JWTs.

* **`ProfileViewSet`**: Manages user profiles, with access control to ensure users can only modify their own profiles, unless they are staff or superusers.  Includes actions to retrieve (`retrieve`), update (`update`), delete (`destroy`), and get the current user's profile (`me`).

* **`LogoutViewSet`**: Handles user logout by blacklisting JWT refresh tokens.

The two log entries are almost identical, suggesting a possible redundant entry or a failed initial commit followed by a successful one without any actual code changes.  There are no patterns of recurring elements beyond the consistent use of Django REST Framework conventions and access control mechanisms.
