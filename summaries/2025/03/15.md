# Activity Summary for 3/15/2025

## 9:30:58 AM
The log shows modifications to `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/personal/tell_a_tale_spot/tell_tales/users/models.py`.  The file defines Django models for a custom User and a Profile.  The User model extends `AbstractUser` and adds a `role` field with choices for 'admin', 'moderator', and 'writer'. The Profile model is a one-to-one relationship with the User model and includes fields for bio, profile picture, expertise, education, hobbies, and cover photo.

The main change between the first and subsequent entries is in the `Profile` model's `created_at` field.  Initially (9:23:00 AM), `created_at` used `default=timezone.now`. This was subsequently changed (9:24:58 AM) to `auto_now_add=True`, a change which was then repeated in the log at (9:25:10 AM).  There were no other code changes between these timestamps.  This suggests a deliberate modification to ensure that the `created_at` field is automatically populated with the creation timestamp.
