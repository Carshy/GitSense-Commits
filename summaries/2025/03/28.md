# Activity Summary for 3/28/2025

## 1:46:43 PM
The log shows two model definition files updated on March 28, 2025.

`/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/personal/tell_a_tale_spot/tell_tales/users/models.py` (1:04:43 PM): This file defines Django models for users and their profiles.  The `User` model extends `AbstractUser` and adds a `role` field with choices for 'admin', 'moderator', and 'writer'. The `Profile` model is linked one-to-one with the `User` model and includes fields for bio, profile picture, expertise, education, hobbies, and a cover photo.  Both models utilize timestamps for creation and updates.

`/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/personal/tell_a_tale_spot/tell_tales/tale_a_tale/models.py` (1:05:05 PM): This file defines models for blog posts and categories.  The `Category` model is simple, storing category names. The `Post` model includes fields for title, author (foreign key to the custom `User` model), profile (foreign key to the `Profile` model), content, excerpt, photo, status (with choices for draft, pending review, revision requested, approved, and published), approved_by (foreign key to `User`), category (foreign key to `Category`), and timestamps.  The relationship between posts and profiles is established using the `related_name='posts'` in the `Profile` model's foreign key, indicating a one-to-many relationship between profiles and posts.

The updates show the creation or significant revision of models for a blog or content management system.  A notable pattern is the consistent use of timestamps (`created_at` and `updated_at`) across all models.  The time difference between the two file updates is minimal, suggesting they were likely modified in a single coding session.
