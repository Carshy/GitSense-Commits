# Activity Summary for 3/6/2025

## 9:37:25 AM
The provided log shows two revisions of the `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/diasorin-v2-admin/components/reuseable/addNewPayitem.vue` file.  Both revisions are nearly identical, suggesting only minor, uncaptured changes occurred between 8:59:19 AM and 9:13:59 AM on March 6th, 2025. The file is a Vue.js component responsible for adding pay items, offering "Single Upload," "Bulk Upload," and "Digital Bulk Upload" options.  The "Single Upload" section features extensive form elements for specifying employee, pay month, type, category, amount (or hours/days depending on the category), and optional attachments and remarks.  The "Bulk Upload" section allows for CSV file uploads, while the "Digital Bulk Upload" section (partially shown) seems designed for a tabular view of pay items.  The component uses Vuetify for UI elements and includes features for handling recurring pay items.  No substantial functional changes are apparent between the two logged versions.
