# Activity Summary for 3/12/2025

## 10:43:48 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/cybergate-admin/components/EOS/calculator.vue` between 10:33 AM and 10:42 AM on March 12, 2025.  The changes primarily focus on the `eligibleNumberOfLeaves` and `computedLeaveAmount` methods within the `<script>` section.

Initially, the `eligibleNumberOfLeaves` method contained a calculation for leave days based on annual leaves,  a start date of the year, and the employee's last working day (`eos.request_details.date_of_leaving`).  Subsequent revisions improved this method's readability and added error handling. A commented-out version of the original method also appeared briefly.  Specifically, the code was refactored to handle cases where `userLeaves` might be undefined, improving robustness.  The final version uses a ternary operator for a more concise expression.  Also, the method now calls `computeTotalCompensation()` after updating leave days to ensure total compensation reflects changes.

The `computedLeaveAmount` method calculates the leave encashment amount based on different salary calculation methods (12dividedBy365, dividedBy30) and work schedules (5 Days, 6 Days).  This method also underwent minor refinements, notably including additional error handling by checking for `NaN` values in `this.eos.request_details.leave_encashment_amount` and setting the values to 0 if `NaN` is found, preventing potential errors. The core logic remains consistent across all versions,  but the structure has been improved slightly for better readability.  All versions emit updates to the `eos` object, specifically affecting `eos.request_details.leave_encashment_days` and `eos.request_details.leave_encashment_amount`.

The template (`<template>`) section remained largely unchanged throughout the revisions.  It's a Vue.js component for an End of Service (EOS) calculator, featuring employee information input, exit information, leave information, and payroll pay item details. There was no change observed in this part of the component.  The changes were limited to the logic handled by the methods in the `<script>` section.


## 11:43:46 AM
The log shows multiple updates to `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/cybergate-admin/components/EOS/calculator.vue` on March 12, 2025.  The changes primarily involve refinements to the UI and functionality of an End of Service (EOS) calculator component.

The most significant changes appear to be minor wording adjustments.  Specifically, "Leave Informations" was corrected to "Leave Information" between the 11:41:01 AM and 11:43:10 AM commits.  The code itself remained largely consistent across all three timestamps, suggesting iterative improvements and bug fixes rather than substantial feature additions or architectural changes.  The core functionality, encompassing employee information input, exit details (last working day, exit status, gratuity), leave information (paid and unpaid leave days), payroll item inclusion, and variable element addition, remains unchanged.  The updates seem focused on small textual corrections and likely minor bug fixes within the existing structure.  No discernible pattern beyond minor cosmetic changes and small bug fixes is observed within the provided logs.


## 12:43:48 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of the `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/cybergate-admin/components/EOS/calculator.vue` file between 11:48 AM and 12:34 PM on March 12, 2025.  The changes primarily focus on the component's functionality related to calculating End of Service (EOS) benefits.

The core functionality remains consistent across all revisions, displaying employee information, exit information (including last working day and exit status), leave information (paid and unpaid leave days), and payroll pay items.  Users can select employees from an autocomplete, and the component calculates leave encashment amounts based on various conditions (work schedule, salary elements, and leave calculation methods).  Variable elements (additions and deductions) can be added and removed.  An alert appears if an EOS application already exists for the selected employee.

Specific changes across the revisions include:

* **11:48 AM and 11:49 AM:** These revisions show no apparent difference in the provided code snippets.

* **12:03 PM:** No discernible changes compared to the previous revisions are present in this snippet.

* **12:24 PM:** The most significant change is the addition of `eligibleNumberOfLeaves()` call within the `@input` event for `eos.request_details.gratuity_amount`. This suggests a modification to how leave days are calculated, triggered by changes in the gratuity amount.

* **12:26 PM:** The `eligibleNumberOfLeaves()` call from the previous revision is removed from the `@input` event of `eos.request_details.gratuity_amount`.  The only apparent change is the shortening of the error message within `positiveNumberRule`.

* **12:27 PM:** The error message in `positiveNumberRule` is further refined, with the addition of "a number" at the end.

* **12:34 PM:** The `eligibleNumberOfLeaves()` method now calls `this.computeTotalCompensation()` at the end.  This ensures the total compensation is recalculated after the eligible number of leaves is determined.


The recurring pattern throughout these revisions is a focus on refining the calculation logic for leave encashment and ensuring that the total compensation is accurately updated whenever relevant input fields are modified.  The changes are incremental and iterative, suggesting a debugging or refinement process.


## 3:49:46 PM
The log shows numerous updates to `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/cybergate-admin/components/EOS/calculator.vue` between 12:46 PM and 3:47 PM on March 12, 2025.  The changes primarily focus on refining the gratuity calculation and handling user input.

Initially, the `updateGratuityAmount` method simply updated the `eos.request_details.gratuity_amount` and recomputed total compensation.  Later versions introduced `handleGratuityChange`, which stores the original gratuity amount (`originalGratuityAmount`) and a flag (`isGratuityManuallyModified`) to distinguish between user-entered and calculated gratuity values.  The `getEmpGratuityCal` method was also modified to respect manual gratuity changes, updating the gratuity only if it wasn't manually modified.  A `resetGratuityToCalculated` method was added to allow resetting the gratuity to its calculated value.  Finally, the gratuity field's `@input` event handler was simplified to directly use `computeTotalCompensation`.


The `computedLeaveAmount` method underwent significant changes to handle various leave calculation scenarios based on `selectedUserPayrollConfig` and the employee's work schedule. These changes involved conditional logic based on different `leave_calculation` values ('12dividedBy365', 'dividedBy30') and work schedules ('5 Days', 'WS05', '6 Days', 'WS06').  The method also now handles cases where the calculated `leave_encashment_amount` is `NaN`, setting both the amount and days to 0.

The `eligibleNumberOfLeaves` method calculates the eligible leave days based on the employee's annual leave balance and the last working day.  It was initially called from within `computedLeaveAmount` but subsequently modified to be called independently from the `@input` event of the gratuity field in order to recalculate leave days if gratuity is changed.

A `watch` block was added to observe changes in `eos.request_details.gratuity_amount` and trigger `computeTotalCompensation`.

The `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/cybergate-admin/components/EOS/endofservice.vue` file was updated at 2:52 PM and 3:16 PM on March 12, 2025.  These updates involved significant restructuring of the component's layout and presentation of EOS information, moving from a swiper component to a more straightforward card-based layout for displaying employee and EOS details.  The changes primarily concern the visual presentation of the data and the removal of the swiper component.


The `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/cybergate-admin/components/EOS/preview.vue` file was updated at 3:18 PM, 3:19 PM, and 3:23 PM on March 12, 2025.  These updates involve enhancements to the data presentation, including the addition of date formatters (`visaDateFormatter`, `dashDateFormatter`, `payrollPayprocess`) for improved readability and the use of the `amountFormatter` method for consistent currency formatting.  There are also changes to the styling and layout of the preview component to better present the EOS information.  The  `thousandSeparator` filter is added to display large numbers with commas.
