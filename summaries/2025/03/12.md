# Activity Summary for 3/12/2025

## 10:43:48 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/cybergate-admin/components/EOS/calculator.vue` between 10:33 AM and 10:42 AM on March 12, 2025.  The changes primarily focus on the `eligibleNumberOfLeaves` and `computedLeaveAmount` methods within the `<script>` section.

Initially, the `eligibleNumberOfLeaves` method contained a calculation for leave days based on annual leaves,  a start date of the year, and the employee's last working day (`eos.request_details.date_of_leaving`).  Subsequent revisions improved this method's readability and added error handling. A commented-out version of the original method also appeared briefly.  Specifically, the code was refactored to handle cases where `userLeaves` might be undefined, improving robustness.  The final version uses a ternary operator for a more concise expression.  Also, the method now calls `computeTotalCompensation()` after updating leave days to ensure total compensation reflects changes.

The `computedLeaveAmount` method calculates the leave encashment amount based on different salary calculation methods (12dividedBy365, dividedBy30) and work schedules (5 Days, 6 Days).  This method also underwent minor refinements, notably including additional error handling by checking for `NaN` values in `this.eos.request_details.leave_encashment_amount` and setting the values to 0 if `NaN` is found, preventing potential errors. The core logic remains consistent across all versions,  but the structure has been improved slightly for better readability.  All versions emit updates to the `eos` object, specifically affecting `eos.request_details.leave_encashment_days` and `eos.request_details.leave_encashment_amount`.

The template (`<template>`) section remained largely unchanged throughout the revisions.  It's a Vue.js component for an End of Service (EOS) calculator, featuring employee information input, exit information, leave information, and payroll pay item details. There was no change observed in this part of the component.  The changes were limited to the logic handled by the methods in the `<script>` section.


## 11:43:46 AM
The log shows multiple updates to `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/cybergate-admin/components/EOS/calculator.vue` on March 12, 2025.  The changes primarily involve refinements to the UI and functionality of an End of Service (EOS) calculator component.

The most significant changes appear to be minor wording adjustments.  Specifically, "Leave Informations" was corrected to "Leave Information" between the 11:41:01 AM and 11:43:10 AM commits.  The code itself remained largely consistent across all three timestamps, suggesting iterative improvements and bug fixes rather than substantial feature additions or architectural changes.  The core functionality, encompassing employee information input, exit details (last working day, exit status, gratuity), leave information (paid and unpaid leave days), payroll item inclusion, and variable element addition, remains unchanged.  The updates seem focused on small textual corrections and likely minor bug fixes within the existing structure.  No discernible pattern beyond minor cosmetic changes and small bug fixes is observed within the provided logs.
