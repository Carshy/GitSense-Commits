# Activity Summary for 3/21/2025

## 10:16:21 AM
The log shows multiple revisions of the `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/systra-admin/pages/payroll/_id.vue` file between 9:33 AM and 9:43 AM on March 21, 2025.  The changes primarily focus on the UI elements related to payroll approval and processing.

The most significant change appears to be the removal of the `submissionAccess` condition from the `v-if` directive within the "Submit for Approval" dialog  between 9:36:54 AM and 9:37:03 AM.  This suggests a simplification of the submission process, potentially making the "Submit for Approval" button always available when the payroll sheet status is 'active'.

Other minor alterations involve no noticeable functional changes in the code, only potentially stylistic or very minor logical changes within the conditional rendering of approval information. The core functionality, including approval/rejection buttons, submission dialogs, and display of approver information, remains consistent across all revisions.  The `services_general.getAvatar` function is replaced by `services_general.getImage` in one revision (9:36:54 AM and later), possibly indicating a refactor or renaming within the `services_general` utility.  The code consistently uses Vue.js components and directives for rendering the user interface.
