The log shows multiple edits to two Vue.js components: `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/cybergate-admin/components/EOS/endofservice.vue` and `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/cybergate-admin/pages/eos/index.vue`.

The `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/cybergate-admin/components/EOS/endofservice.vue` file underwent three revisions between 9:10 AM and 9:14 AM on March 11, 2025.  These revisions appear to be minor cosmetic changes and renaming.  The most significant change was the renaming of "EOSB Calculator" to "MY EOS Calculator" in the card title.  The overall structure and functionality of the component remained largely consistent across these revisions.

The `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/cybergate-admin/pages/eos/index.vue` file was modified four times between 9:26 AM and 9:32 AM on March 11, 2025.  These changes primarily involved the addition and refinement of filtering and search capabilities within the UI.  There were also updates to the button styling and the addition of a date picker for filtering requests.  The primary function (managing EOS requests) remained unchanged.  The changes suggest iterative improvements to the user interface and functionality for filtering and searching EOS application data.

The log shows numerous edits to two Vue component files: `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/cybergate-admin/pages/eos/index.vue` and `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/cybergate-admin/components/EOS/endofservice.vue`.  The changes span approximately one hour on March 11th, 2025.

`/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/cybergate-admin/pages/eos/index.vue`: This file underwent several revisions, primarily focusing on UI enhancements and refinements.  The most significant changes involved refining the search functionality and updating the visual presentation, including styling adjustments, button modifications, and the addition/removal of certain elements.  There's a consistent use of Vuetify components (`v-row`, `v-col`, `v-card`, `v-text-field`, `v-img`, etc.) throughout the code.

`/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/cybergate-admin/components/EOS/endofservice.vue`: This file, also underwent multiple revisions between 9:42 AM and 10:27 AM. The major changes in this file revolve around the structure and presentation of EOS Calculator data.  Specifically, there's a focus on improving the layout and presentation of employee information, exit information, leave information, and payroll details within the calculator section.  The use of Vuetify components is also prominent here.  A noticeable change is the addition of a border around the component for debugging purposes, visible in some revisions. The final version removed commented-out code and streamlined the structure of the 'Gratuity Payable Days' section, removing redundancy.  The changes are primarily aesthetic and organizational.

A recurring pattern across both files is the extensive use of Vuetify components and consistent styling, particularly using  `darkBlue-heading-text`, `grey lighten-3`, `rounded-xl`, and other custom classes for styling consistency.  The frequent updates suggest iterative development and refinement of the UI and data presentation within the EOS (End of Service) application.
