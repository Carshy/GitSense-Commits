# Activity Summary for 3/11/2025

## 9:33:01 AM
The log shows multiple edits to two Vue.js components: `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/cybergate-admin/components/EOS/endofservice.vue` and `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/cybergate-admin/pages/eos/index.vue`.

The `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/cybergate-admin/components/EOS/endofservice.vue` file underwent three revisions between 9:10 AM and 9:14 AM on March 11, 2025.  These revisions appear to be minor cosmetic changes and renaming.  The most significant change was the renaming of "EOSB Calculator" to "MY EOS Calculator" in the card title.  The overall structure and functionality of the component remained largely consistent across these revisions.

The `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/cybergate-admin/pages/eos/index.vue` file was modified four times between 9:26 AM and 9:32 AM on March 11, 2025.  These changes primarily involved the addition and refinement of filtering and search capabilities within the UI.  There were also updates to the button styling and the addition of a date picker for filtering requests.  The primary function (managing EOS requests) remained unchanged.  The changes suggest iterative improvements to the user interface and functionality for filtering and searching EOS application data.
