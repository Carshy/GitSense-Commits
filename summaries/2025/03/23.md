# Activity Summary for 3/23/2025

## 9:18:20 AM
On March 23, 2025, at 9:09:28 AM, significant changes were made to `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/personal/tell_a_tale_spot/tell_tales/users/views.py`.  The file contains Django REST framework code implementing user registration, login, profile management, and logout functionalities.

The key updates include:

* **User Registration and Management (`RegisterViewSet`):** This viewset handles user creation,  with administrative controls allowing superusers to view and manage all users while regular users can only access their own information.  The `create`, `profile`, `update_user`, and `delete_user` actions are defined, each with appropriate permission checks (`IsAuthenticated`, `IsAdminUser`).

* **Login (`LoginView`):** A simple login view using `TokenObtainPairView` is implemented, allowing users to obtain JWT tokens.

* **Profile Management (`ProfileViewSet`):**  This viewset manages user profiles.  Admin users can access all profiles, while regular users are restricted to their own.  It includes actions for retrieval, update, deletion, and a convenient endpoint (`me`) to retrieve the user's own profile.  Robust permission checks are incorporated to prevent unauthorized access and modification.

* **Logout (`LogoutViewSet`):** A logout view is added to blacklist refresh tokens, ensuring proper session termination.  Error handling is included for invalid tokens.


A recurring pattern is the consistent use of permission classes (`IsAuthenticated`, `IsAdminUser`, `AllowAny`) to control access to different API endpoints, ensuring data security and proper role-based authorization.  The code extensively uses Django REST framework features, including viewsets, serializers, and JWT authentication.  Several commented-out sections suggest features that may have been considered but not yet implemented or are planned for future development.
