# Activity Summary for 3/20/2025

## 9:54:22 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/nd-maintenance-admin/components/reuseable/addNewPayitem.vue` on March 20, 2025.  The file is a Vue component responsible for adding pay items, offering both single and bulk upload functionalities.

The primary changes revolve around the "Add Recurring Pay Item" feature within the "Single Upload" tab.  Early revisions show the initial implementation, with subsequent updates focusing on refining the user interface and functionality.  Specifically, there's a notable shift in how recurring pay item types ("Limited" and "Unlimited") are handled. Initially, there was a more complex nested structure for these options; later revisions simplified this by using a `v-if` to conditionally render fields based on the selected `recurring.request_type`.  The "Add Pay Item" button's behavior also changed, initially labeled "Add Pay Itemssss" before being corrected.  A "Preview" button was added for Limited recurring types around 9:26:03 AM.  The final change at 9:38:57 AM corrected a conditional statement in the button logic for adding pay items. The changes between 9:24:07 AM and 9:38:57 AM focused primarily on refining the conditional rendering of UI elements related to recurring pay item types, improving the overall clarity and functionality of the form.  All changes occurred within a relatively short timeframe between 9:09:48 AM and 9:38:57 AM.
