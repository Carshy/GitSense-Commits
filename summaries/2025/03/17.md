# Activity Summary for 3/17/2025

## 10:39:05 AM
The log shows a single entry for `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/nd-maintenance-admin/components/configurations/companies/companyConfig.vue` modified on March 17, 2025, at 10:38:53 AM.  This Vue component displays and manages company data.  Key updates include:

* **UI Enhancements:** The component's UI was significantly updated to include a search bar, data table for company listings, buttons for adding new companies and viewing existing ones, and success alerts for company deletion.  The table displays company name, address, email, and provides view actions.  The styling uses Vuetify components (`v-layout`, `v-container`, `v-btn`, etc.).

* **Data Handling:** The component fetches company data and approval manager data via axios calls, using bearer tokens for authentication. It handles adding, viewing, editing and deleting companies.  The `getManagers()` method retrieves approval managers from the `/users/approval/managers/` endpoint.  Company deletion is performed via a DELETE request to `/companies/delete/{id}`. The component uses reactive data properties (`addCompany`, `showPerCompany`, `showCompanies`, `search`, etc.) to manage the UI state.

* **Component Composition:** The component uses sub-components `AddCompany` and `CompanyEdit` for adding and editing companies respectively. These are imported from other files within the `components/configurations/companies` directory.

* **Error Handling:** While there is a mechanism to catch errors during company deletion, the error is simply pushed to an `errors` array (which is not displayed in the provided code). More robust error handling would improve user experience.

In summary, this commit represents a substantial update to the company management section of the application, providing a complete user interface for viewing, adding, editing, and deleting company records with clear feedback mechanisms.  The use of Vuex (implied by `this.$store.getters.getToken`) suggests that the application uses a state management system.


## 11:39:06 AM
The log shows code changes across three files on March 17, 2025.  The most significant changes are in `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/nd-maintenance-admin/pages/payroll-configuration/popup.vue` at 10:41:50 AM, reflecting a substantial update to a Vue.js component related to payroll configuration. This component features a tabbed interface allowing management of various aspects of payroll, including general settings, pay item setup, salary sheets, approval flows, and email setup. The `payitemSetup` tab, in particular, allows for adding, editing, and removing pay items of different categories (fixed, earning, deduction, recurring earning, recurring deduction) using Vuetify components like `v-combobox` and `v-chip`.

The `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/nd-maintenance-admin/plugins/general.js` file underwent multiple edits between 10:50:03 AM and 10:51:38 AM. These edits consist of additions and no deletions to utility functions within a Javascript plugin file. The functions predominantly deal with date formatting, currency conversion based on country, status and color handling, user information retrieval, salary configuration processing, text manipulation, and data formatting for payroll applications.  The repeated updates suggest iterative refinement or bug fixes to these utility functions.

Finally, at 11:33:18 AM, `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/nd-maintenance-admin/components/configurations/DocumentConfigurator/index.vue` was updated. This Vue.js component manages document templates, allowing users to select modules (like payslips), choose or create templates, and edit their content.  The component provides a preview of the document and allows for managing replacement keys and input keys.  The ability to add new document templates is also included via a modal.  The component uses several subcomponents (`PreviewDocument`, `ModifyInputKeys`, `ModifyReplaceKeys`, `ModifyDocument`) loaded client-side.


## 1:55:58 PM
The log shows two commits to `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/apis/nd-maintenance-api/src/controllers/document_templates.controller.js`, both within a short time frame (2 minutes apart) on March 17, 2025.  The changes are primarily additions to the controller file.

The first commit at 1:53:19 PM includes functions for various document template operations: retrieving all templates, creating single and multiple templates, retrieving by ID and config ID, updating, deleting, retrieving all fields,  retrieving replaced content for payslips, generating a PDF from that content, and retrieving document modules. Each function uses `catchAsync` for error handling and logs using `loggerService` to track success or failure.  The responses are consistently structured JSON objects with `success`, `message`, and `data` fields.

The second commit at 1:55:28 PM adds a single line to the `module.exports` section, exporting the `createDocumentTemplateMany` function. This suggests a refactoring or feature addition to allow for bulk document template creation.  The rest of the code remains identical between the two commits.  The addition of this function is the only change between the two commits.  Both commits show consistent error handling and logging throughout all functions.
