# Activity Summary for 3/17/2025

## 10:39:05 AM
The log shows a single entry for `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/nd-maintenance-admin/components/configurations/companies/companyConfig.vue` modified on March 17, 2025, at 10:38:53 AM.  This Vue component displays and manages company data.  Key updates include:

* **UI Enhancements:** The component's UI was significantly updated to include a search bar, data table for company listings, buttons for adding new companies and viewing existing ones, and success alerts for company deletion.  The table displays company name, address, email, and provides view actions.  The styling uses Vuetify components (`v-layout`, `v-container`, `v-btn`, etc.).

* **Data Handling:** The component fetches company data and approval manager data via axios calls, using bearer tokens for authentication. It handles adding, viewing, editing and deleting companies.  The `getManagers()` method retrieves approval managers from the `/users/approval/managers/` endpoint.  Company deletion is performed via a DELETE request to `/companies/delete/{id}`. The component uses reactive data properties (`addCompany`, `showPerCompany`, `showCompanies`, `search`, etc.) to manage the UI state.

* **Component Composition:** The component uses sub-components `AddCompany` and `CompanyEdit` for adding and editing companies respectively. These are imported from other files within the `components/configurations/companies` directory.

* **Error Handling:** While there is a mechanism to catch errors during company deletion, the error is simply pushed to an `errors` array (which is not displayed in the provided code). More robust error handling would improve user experience.

In summary, this commit represents a substantial update to the company management section of the application, providing a complete user interface for viewing, adding, editing, and deleting company records with clear feedback mechanisms.  The use of Vuex (implied by `this.$store.getters.getToken`) suggests that the application uses a state management system.
