# Activity Summary for 3/13/2025

## 9:33:13 AM
The provided log shows three consecutive updates to `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/cybergate-admin/components/EOS/calculator.vue`  within a minute on March 13, 2025.  The changes appear to be minor and iterative.  The core functionality of the component, a calculator for End of Service (EOS) benefits, remains consistent across all three revisions.

The key difference between the versions lies within the `data()` section of the component's script. Specifically, the initialization of the `override_gratuity_amount` variable changes. In the first version, it's initialized as simply `eos.`, while in the subsequent two versions, it's initialized to `eos.request_details.gratuity_amount`. This suggests a refinement to ensure the gratuity amount is correctly sourced from the `eos.request_details` object.  No other significant structural or functional changes are observable from the provided snippets.  The timestamps show rapid iterationâ€”likely debugging or minor adjustment to data handling.
