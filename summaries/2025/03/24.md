The component includes extensive form elements for specifying employee details, pay amounts, recurring type (limited or unlimited), start and end dates (for limited type), and remarks.  A preview dialog is available for "Limited" recurring types to show how deductions will be applied over installments.  The "Bulk Upload" tab allows for CSV file uploads after selecting a company.
