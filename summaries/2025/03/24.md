## 12:25:13 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/nd-maintenance-admin/components/reuseable/addNewPayitem.vue` between 11:44 AM and 12:21 PM on March 24, 2025.  The file is a Vue component responsible for adding pay items, offering both single and bulk upload functionalities.  No significant code changes are observed across these revisions; all changes seem minor and likely related to formatting or very small adjustments within the existing structure. The component uses Vuetify for its UI elements (v-dialog, v-btn, v-card, v-tabs, v-autocomplete, v-switch, v-radio-group, v-combobox, v-text-field, v-textarea, v-data-table).  The "Single Upload" tab allows for adding single pay items with options for recurring payments ("Limited" or "Unlimited"), employee selection, category selection, amount, start month, and end month (for limited recurring types).  A preview dialog is available for "Limited" recurring types. The "Bulk Upload" tab provides functionality to upload pay items via a CSV file.  The timestamps indicate frequent, but small edits, rather than large-scale refactoring.
