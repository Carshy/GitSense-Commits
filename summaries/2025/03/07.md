# Activity Summary for 3/7/2025

## 6:26:58 AM
The log shows a single code change to `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/personal/tell_a_tale_spot/tell_tales/tell_tales/urls.py` at 3/7/2025, 5:54:24 AM.  This file defines Django URL routing. The update includes routes for the Django admin interface (`/admin/`), and API endpoints for 'tale_a_tale' and 'users' apps (`/api/`).  Conditional logic adds media serving routes if the `settings.DEBUG` flag is true.  The primary change is the configuration of URL patterns to include two API applications.


## 9:34:52 AM
The log shows multiple edits to `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/diasorin-v2-admin/components/datatables/payItemDT.vue`  between 8:50 AM and 9:33 AM on March 7, 2025.  The core functionality of the component, a Vue.js data table displaying pay items, remains consistent throughout all revisions.  Changes primarily focus on the `DownloadFile` method.

The initial version (8:50 AM) included a commented-out preview button and a redundant `item.action` slot.  Subsequent revisions (8:52 AM and 8:53 AM) removed this redundancy and the commented-out code.  There were several almost identical commits between 8:52 AM and 9:09 AM suggesting some form of accidental multiple commits and there is no significant code difference between these commits.


A significant change occurred around 9:21 AM. The `DownloadFile` method was heavily revised. The original implementation used `window.open` to open URLs in new tabs. The revised version uses  `document.createElement('a')` to create a hidden anchor element, setting the `href` and `download` attributes, then programmatically clicking and removing it to initiate downloads. This change improves the download process, providing more control and potentially better handling of multiple files.  Error handling was also improved by adding  `this.$toast?.error` or alerts for both invalid file URLs and download failures.  Success messages were also added using `this.$toast`.  A small delay between downloads is introduced to mitigate browser throttling.

The final revision at 9:33 AM made a minor adjustment to the `DownloadFile` method.  Instead of expecting an array of URLs, it now expects an array of file objects, each with `url` and `name` properties, further enhancing download management. The fallback to open the URL in a new tab if the download fails remains unchanged.  The change at 9:33:31 is almost identical to the commit at 9:33:45 AM, again suggesting accidental duplicate commits.
