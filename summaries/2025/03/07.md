The log shows a single code change to `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/personal/tell_a_tale_spot/tell_tales/tell_tales/urls.py` at 3/7/2025, 5:54:24 AM.  This file defines Django URL routing. The update includes routes for the Django admin interface (`/admin/`), and API endpoints for 'tale_a_tale' and 'users' apps (`/api/`).  Conditional logic adds media serving routes if the `settings.DEBUG` flag is true.  The primary change is the configuration of URL patterns to include two API applications.
