The log shows a single code change to `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/personal/tell_a_tale_spot/tell_tales/tale_a_tale/permissions.py` on March 30th, 2025 at 9:06:24 AM.  This change introduces a custom permission class, `PostPermissions`, for managing posts within a likely Django REST framework application.  The class defines `has_permission` and `has_object_permission` methods to control access based on user roles (superuser, admin, moderator, writer) and HTTP methods (POST, PATCH, PUT).  Specifically, it allows authenticated users to create posts, admins to fully manage posts, moderators to edit posts, and writers to edit only their own posts.  The code uses a granular permission system based on user roles and HTTP request methods to control post creation and modification.
