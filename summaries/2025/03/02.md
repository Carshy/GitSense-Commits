# Activity Summary for 3/2/2025

## 11:10:56 AM
The log shows a single code change on March 2nd, 2025, at 10:08:20 AM, to the file `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/personal/Musoko-DSA-Series/Arrays_and_Vectors/1. Two Sum.js`.  This file contains a JavaScript function `twoSum` which solves the two-sum problem: finding two numbers in an array that add up to a given target.  The code implements a hash map approach for efficient solution.  There's a minor code correction between the commented-out initial attempt and the final working version, mainly in the return statement of the `if` condition to correct index retrieval. The `console.log` statements demonstrate usage with example inputs.
