## 10:22:44 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/diasorin-v2-admin/components/reuseable/addNewPayitem.vue` between 9:22 AM and 10:15 AM on March 5th, 2025.  The changes appear to be minor edits and do not alter the core functionality of the component, which is a form for adding payroll pay items.  The component has three tabs: "Singled Upload," "Bulk Upload," and "Digital Bulk Upload." The "Single Upload" tab is the most extensively detailed section in the component. It  focuses on adding individual pay items, with options for recurring pay items and various input fields for employee selection, pay month, type (earning/deduction), category, amount, attachments, and remarks. The bulk upload sections handle CSV file uploads for adding multiple pay items at once.  There are no significant structural or functional changes across the revisions within the given timeframe; the timestamps suggest iterative refinements or minor bug fixes rather than substantial updates.

## 12:22:33 PM
The log shows a single entry for `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/apis/diasorin-v2-api/.env` at 3/5/2025, 11:23:28 AM.  This file contains numerous environment variables, primarily related to database connections (multiple MongoDB URLs, including staging and production instances for both `Diasorin-v2` and a 'central' database), email services (SendGrid), authentication (JWT keys, 2FA settings), messaging services (Etisalat), AWS credentials (access key, secret key and ID),  and OAuth configuration for Microsoft single sign-on.  Several URLs are defined, pointing to both development and staging environments for various services, including a web application (`hrdirect-staging.devnhr.com`), and API endpoints.  The `DATABASE_URL` variable shows multiple commented-out options suggesting iterative changes to the database connection.  There are also numerous variables related to application settings and configurations, such as client support email, login attempts, and token expiration times.  The file also includes commented-out and modified URLs throughout, indicating potential changes in deployment or development environment switches.


## 12:22:44 PM
The log shows multiple edits to `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/diasorin-v2-admin/components/reuseable/addNewPayitem.vue` on March 5th, 2025.  The changes primarily focus on the "Single Upload" tab within a Vue.js component for adding payroll pay items.  There are also sections for "Bulk Upload" and "Digital Bulk Upload," but these sections remain largely unchanged across the log entries.

The most significant modifications were made between 11:39 AM and 12:21 PM. These changes involved refining the user interface for adding recurring pay items.  Specifically, the addition of a file upload for recurring pay items is a notable change introduced between 11:58 AM and 12:21 PM, as the initial log entry at 11:39 AM lacked this feature.  The conditional rendering (`v-if`) statements were adjusted to include the file input component only when `addRecurring` is true.  Before this addition the file input was only available for non-recurring pay items.  There were also minor adjustments to conditional rendering logic within the `v-if` and `v-else-if` statements throughout the Single Upload section, though the core functionality seems unchanged.  The structure and overall content of the component remain consistent across all log entries.
