# Activity Summary for 3/3/2025

## 11:27:52 AM
The log shows multiple revisions of two Vue.js components: `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/hecqatar-admin/pages/payroll/_id.vue` and `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/hecqatar-admin/components/datatables/payItemDT.vue`.

The `/pages/payroll/_id.vue` component,  underwent several revisions between 10:31 AM and 10:34 AM on March 3rd, 2025.  These revisions appear to be minor adjustments and do not reflect substantial functional changes. The core functionality of the component, which involves displaying and managing payroll information including approval processes, remained consistent throughout these revisions.  The component uses Vuetify for UI elements and handles actions such as approval, rejection, submission for approval, and closing of salary sheets.  It also displays approver information and provides options for downloading reports.

The `/components/datatables/payItemDT.vue` component was revised three times between 10:49 AM and 10:52 AM on March 3rd, 2025. The main change involves uncommenting a `<template>` block responsible for displaying the amount field in the data table, adding styling based on the `earning_type` (green for Earnings, red for Deductions, amber for others).  Before this, the amount column was commented out.  The component is a data table displaying pay items.  It uses a `PayslipDateFormatter` filter and provides a "View" button for each pay item, linking to an edit page.  The component also dynamically formats numbers with commas as thousands separators.
