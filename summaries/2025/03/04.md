# Activity Summary for 3/4/2025

## 6:26:47 AM
The `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/personal/tell_a_tale_spot/tell_tales/users/services/serviceUsers.py` file was updated on March 4th, 2025 at 5:25:41 AM.  The update modifies the `UserPermissionService` class, specifically the `set_user_permissions` method. This method assigns different permission levels (is_superuser, is_staff) to users based on their roles ('admin', 'moderator', 'writer').  Admins receive both superuser and staff privileges, while moderators and writers only receive staff privileges.  The `user.save()` call persists the changes to the database.  The primary change is the logic for assigning permissions based on user roles.
