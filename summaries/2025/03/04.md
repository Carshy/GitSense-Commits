# Activity Summary for 3/4/2025

## 6:26:47 AM
The `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/personal/tell_a_tale_spot/tell_tales/users/services/serviceUsers.py` file was updated on March 4th, 2025 at 5:25:41 AM.  The update modifies the `UserPermissionService` class, specifically the `set_user_permissions` method. This method assigns different permission levels (is_superuser, is_staff) to users based on their roles ('admin', 'moderator', 'writer').  Admins receive both superuser and staff privileges, while moderators and writers only receive staff privileges.  The `user.save()` call persists the changes to the database.  The primary change is the logic for assigning permissions based on user roles.

The `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/admin/diasorin-v2-admin/package.json` file was updated on 3/4/2025 at 11:31:54 AM.  This file is a `package.json` file for a Nuxt.js project named "NATHAN_ERP", a HR ERP platform.  The update includes numerous npm package dependencies and devDependencies, indicating a potentially large and feature-rich application.  Many of the dependencies relate to charting (ApexCharts, Chart.js, vue-chartjs), calendar functionality (@fullcalendar/*), UI components (Vuetify, Syncfusion components), PDF handling (jspdf, pdfjs-dist), and email services (@sendgrid/mail).  The scripts section defines various build, development, and deployment commands for different environments (dev, staging, production).  The use of `nodemon` suggests hot-reloading during development.  The `NODE_OPTIONS` setting adjusts the memory allocation for webpack, likely due to project size.  The presence of  `@nathangroup` packages suggests internal modules or components developed for the Nathan HR group.
