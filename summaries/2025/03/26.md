# Activity Summary for 3/26/2025

## 1:44:02 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/personal/tell_a_tale_spot/tell_tales/users/views.py` on March 26th, 2025.  The file contains Django REST Framework code for user authentication and profile management.

The primary focus of the revisions appears to be refining user permissions. Initially, there's some experimentation with different permission classes (`IsAuthenticated`, `IsAdminUser`, `IsAdminOrSelf`) within the `RegisterViewSet`,  `ProfileViewSet`, and other viewsets.  The `RegisterViewSet` consistently undergoes changes related to restricting `create`, `update`, and `destroy` actions to only staff/superuser users.

There are several iterations where the `RegisterViewSet`'s `serializer_class` is changed between `RegisterSerializer` and `UserSerializer`.  The final version settles on `RegisterSerializer` and `IsAuthenticated`, `IsAdminUser` permission classes.

A significant change occurs around 1:19 PM where a typo ("user.ok" instead of "user.pk") in the `RegisterViewSet`'s `get_queryset` method is corrected.

Throughout the revisions, the `ProfileViewSet` maintains consistent logic to allow admin users to access all profiles while restricting regular users to their own profiles. This logic is present in the `get_queryset`, `retrieve`, `update`, and `destroy` methods.  The `LogoutViewSet` remains unchanged, consistently handling logout requests using JWT refresh tokens.  The changes primarily focus on authorization and access control rather than major functional additions or alterations.

The `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/personal/tell_a_tale_spot/tell_tales/users/views.py` file was updated on 3/26/2025, 1:45:38 PM.  The update significantly enhances user authentication and authorization within a Django REST Framework application.

The changes introduce three primary viewsets: `RegisterViewSet`, `ProfileViewSet`, and `LogoutViewSet`.

`RegisterViewSet` handles user registration, with strict access control: only staff/superuser users can create, update, or delete user accounts.  A custom `me` action allows users to retrieve their own details.

`ProfileViewSet` manages user profiles, linked to the User model.  Similar access control is implemented: admins can view and manage all profiles, while regular users can only access their own profile.  The `perform_create` method prevents duplicate profile creation for a user.  A convenient `me` action is also included to retrieve the user's own profile.  Update and delete actions also have access control.

`LogoutViewSet` provides a logout functionality by blacklisting refresh tokens.  Error handling is included for invalid or expired tokens.

Throughout the code, there is a consistent pattern of robust permission checks using `IsAuthenticated`, `IsAdminUser`, and `AllowAny` permissions classes to ensure only authorized users can perform specific actions.  The use of `get_object_or_404` helps to handle cases where objects are not found gracefully.  The code utilizes Django's `get_user_model()` for better flexibility and maintainability. The use of `rest_framework_simplejwt` indicates the application uses JSON Web Tokens for authentication.
