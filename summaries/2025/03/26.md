# Activity Summary for 3/26/2025

## 1:44:02 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of `/Users/collinsmusoko/Projects/personal/tell_a_tale_spot/tell_tales/users/views.py` on March 26th, 2025.  The file contains Django REST Framework code for user authentication and profile management.

The primary focus of the revisions appears to be refining user permissions. Initially, there's some experimentation with different permission classes (`IsAuthenticated`, `IsAdminUser`, `IsAdminOrSelf`) within the `RegisterViewSet`,  `ProfileViewSet`, and other viewsets.  The `RegisterViewSet` consistently undergoes changes related to restricting `create`, `update`, and `destroy` actions to only staff/superuser users.

There are several iterations where the `RegisterViewSet`'s `serializer_class` is changed between `RegisterSerializer` and `UserSerializer`.  The final version settles on `RegisterSerializer` and `IsAuthenticated`, `IsAdminUser` permission classes.

A significant change occurs around 1:19 PM where a typo ("user.ok" instead of "user.pk") in the `RegisterViewSet`'s `get_queryset` method is corrected.

Throughout the revisions, the `ProfileViewSet` maintains consistent logic to allow admin users to access all profiles while restricting regular users to their own profiles. This logic is present in the `get_queryset`, `retrieve`, `update`, and `destroy` methods.  The `LogoutViewSet` remains unchanged, consistently handling logout requests using JWT refresh tokens.  The changes primarily focus on authorization and access control rather than major functional additions or alterations.
