# Activity Summary for 2/3/2026

## 10:55:18 AM
The provided log details a series of changes focused on setting up user management and related employee models within a Django project, `tale-craft-media.api`. The updates occurred primarily on **February 3, 2026**, spanning from approximately **8:50 AM to 10:52 AM**.

Here's a breakdown of the key changes by file:

**`c:\projects\tat\tale-craft-media.api\tale_craft\apps\users\models\__init__.py`**
This file, active from 8:50:05 AM to 10:16:17 AM, shows an evolution of its imports. It initially started as an incomplete import statement and then progressively added imports for `User` and `Profile` models. A significant change occurred around 10:16:17 AM when `Profile` was explicitly imported as `PublicProfile`, suggesting a renaming or clarification of the profile model's purpose.

**`c:\projects\tat\tale-craft-media.api\tale_craft\apps\users\signals.py`**
Changes in this file occurred between 8:52:58 AM and 10:17:52 AM. It consistently defines four `post_save` signal receivers for the `User` model:
1.  `create_user_profile`: Creates a related profile upon user creation.
2.  `save_user_profile`: Saves the user's profile.
3.  `assign_role_to_superuser`: Assigns an 'admin' role if the created user is a superuser.
4.  `set_user_permissions_on_save`: Sets user permissions via `UserPermissionService` upon creation.
The primary modifications throughout these entries involve refining import paths for `User` and `Profile` (which was eventually renamed to `PublicProfile` and updated within the `create_user_profile` function at 10:17:52 AM). There were also intermediate typos like `ProUser` and `PProfile` that were quickly corrected.

**`c:\projects\tat\tale-craft-media.api\tale_craft\apps\users\models\profile.py`**
This file was significantly updated between 9:38:53 AM and 9:39:26 AM. It introduces the `PublicProfile` model, which includes fields such as `user` (a OneToOneField linked to the authentication user model), `bio`, `profile_picture`, `cover_photo`, `expertise`, `education`, `created_at`, and `updated_at`. Initial commits were missing necessary `django.db` and `django.conf` imports, which were added shortly after.

**`c:\projects\tat\tale-craft-media.api\tale_craft\apps\posts\apps.py`**
At 10:05:31 AM, this file was updated to define the `PostsConfig` for the `apps.posts` Django application, including the `default_auto_field` setting.

**`c:\projects\tat\tale-craft-media.api\tale_craft\apps\users\managers\__init__.py`**
Between 10:09:14 AM and 10:09:30 AM, this file was updated to correctly import and expose `UserManager` from `user_manager.py` within the same directory.

**`c:\projects\tat\tale-craft-media.api\tale_craft\apps\users\models\user.py`**
At 10:13:04 AM, the `User` model was defined. It extends `AbstractBaseUser` and `PermissionsMixin`, uses a custom `UserManager`, and includes fields for `email` (unique, used as `USERNAME_FIELD`), `username` (unique), `is_active`, `is_staff`, `date_joined`, and `updated_at`. It also defines `db_table="users"` and indexes on `email` and `username`.

**`c:\projects\tat\tale-craft-media.api\tale_craft\apps\employees\models\personal_details.py`**
Between 10:50:08 AM and 10:50:48 AM, this file introduces the `PersonalDetails` model. This model has a OneToOneField `user` linked to the authentication user model, and includes fields like `phone`, `date_of_birth`, `gender`, `marital_status`, `nationality`, and `national_id`. Similar to `profile.py`, initial commits were missing necessary Django imports which were subsequently added.

**`c:\projects\tat\tale-craft-media.api\tale_craft\apps\employees\models\emergency_contact.py`**
Between 10:52:08 AM and 10:52:29 AM, the `EmergencyContact` model was defined. It features a OneToOneField `employee` (referencing an `employees.Employee` model), and fields for `name`, `relationship`, `phone`, and `email`. The initial change was missing the `django.db` import, which was quickly rectified.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Django Model Definitions:** A recurring pattern is the creation of new Django models (`PublicProfile`, `User`, `PersonalDetails`, `EmergencyContact`) within dedicated `models` directories for different apps (`users`, `employees`). These models frequently include `OneToOneField` relationships to other user/employee entities and basic informational fields.
*   **Import Refinements:** Many changes involve fixing or refining import statements. This often includes adding `from django.db import models` and `from django.conf import settings` to model files, and adjusting relative/absolute import paths (`.models` vs. `apps.users.models`) in `__init__.py` and `signals.py`.
*   **User Management Focus:** A significant portion of the changes centers around the `users` app, including defining the custom `User` model, `PublicProfile`, and robust signal handling for user creation and updates.
*   **Typo Correction:** Several quick consecutive commits or log entries show corrections for typos in class names (`ProUser`, `PProfile`, `ProPublicProfilefile`) within import statements and function bodies.
*   **Timestamp Clustering:** Most changes occurred in concentrated bursts, particularly around 8:50 AM, 9:39 AM, and 10:09 AM to 10:17 AM, and then again around 10:50 AM to 10:52 AM, indicating focused development sessions on specific components.
