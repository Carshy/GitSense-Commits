# Activity Summary for 2/22/2026

## 1:49:20 PM
The `package.json` file for the `node_crash2026` project was initialized on February 22, 2026, at 12:37:06 PM with basic project metadata. Shortly after, at 12:37:18 PM, a descriptive `"description": "This is node crash course project"` was added to it.

The `index.js` file underwent several transformations. It began at 12:39:06 PM with a simple `console.log('Hellow node js collins is here to l')`, which was quickly corrected to `console.log('Hellow node js collins is here to learn you')` by 12:39:14 PM. A significant change occurred at 12:48:38 PM when the file was cleared. It was then progressively rebuilt from 12:49:07 PM, starting with an attempt to import a module (`const RandomNumber = require('')`), evolving to correctly `require('./utils')`, and finally, by 12:54:22 PM, logging the result of calling the imported function: `console.log(`My random number is: ${RandomNumber()}`);`.

The `utils.js` file shows a highly iterative development process from 12:46:08 PM to 12:56:13 PM, focused on creating and exporting a random number generator. Initially, the `RandomNumber` function's definition was refined through several steps, transitioning from incomplete attempts like `const RandomNumber` and `const RandomNumber()` to correctly defining an arrow function: `const RandomNumber = () => { return Math.floor(Math.random() * 200) + 1; }` by 12:47:51 PM. Following this, the export mechanism was also iteratively corrected. Early attempts included `export` and `exports.RandomNumber = RandomNumber;`, with some typos, until it settled on the CommonJS `module.exports = RandomNumber;` by 12:56:13 PM.

Key patterns observed include a highly iterative and corrective development style, particularly evident in the `utils.js` file where both function syntax and module export syntax were refined over numerous small changes. All recorded changes occurred on February 22, 2026, within a concise timeframe, indicating a focused development session. The consistent use of `require` and `module.exports` confirms the project's adherence to the Node.js CommonJS module system, with a clear focus on module creation and consumption. The overall goal appears to be building a basic Node.js application that leverages a custom utility to generate and display random numbers.
