# Activity Summary for 2/15/2026

## 12:08:11 AM
The changes in the log exclusively pertain to the file `c:\projects\Musoko-DSA-Series\Python\1. Two Sum.py`.

The development of this file can be broadly categorized into two distinct phases, all occurring on **February 14, 2026**:

**Phase 1: Implementation and Refinement of the "Two Sum" Algorithm (3:42:33 PM - 3:56:22 PM)**
This initial period focused on solving the classic "Two Sum" problem.
*   **3:42:33 PM**: The first entry shows a complete Python `twoSum` function implementing a hash map approach to find two numbers that add up to a target, returning their indices.
*   **3:45:48 PM**: The function name was changed from `twoSum` to `twoSums`.
*   **3:46:19 PM - 3:49:28 PM**: The `twoSums` function was progressively re-implemented from an empty function, line by line, to mirror the original `twoSum` logic using `map = {}`, `enumerate`, `complement` calculation, conditional return, and storing `map[num] = i`. This suggests a potential refactoring or re-learning of the solution structure.
*   **3:54:40 PM - 3:56:22 PM**: Minor adjustments and debugging attempts were made to the return statement, briefly changing `return [map[complement], i]` to return `complement` or `num` directly before reverting to the correct index lookup. Test print statements were also added and corrected to call `twoSums`.

**Phase 2: Dictionary/Object Exploration (5:58:31 PM - 8:46:57 PM)**
Following a break, the code completely shifted focus. The previously implemented `twoSums` function was entirely commented out, and the file was repurposed for experimenting with Python dictionaries.
*   **5:58:31 PM - 6:00:32 PM**: The `twoSums` function was commented out, and a new, undefined function (`prs`, `person`, `human`) was briefly attempted before a `person` dictionary was directly defined.
*   **6:00:52 PM - 6:02:19 PM**: Initial attempts at accessing dictionary values using both direct key lookup (`person["name"]`) and the `.get()` method, including trying to access non-existent keys to observe behavior.
*   **6:03:06 PM - 6:03:55 PM**: Attempts were made to encapsulate dictionary access within a `getPerson` function, initially struggling with the correct syntax for returning values and printing the result.
*   **6:33:46 PM - 6:42:32 PM**: The `getPerson` function was refined to define and return a hardcoded dictionary (`{"name": "Collins", "age": 23, "email": "collins@gmail.com"}`). Extensive experimentation followed on how to call the function and retrieve specific values (e.g., `getPerson().get("name")`, `getPerson()["name"]`, `getPerson().get("password", "Does not exist")`).
*   **6:48:48 PM - 6:50:38 PM**: Further attempts to retrieve and interact with dictionary data, including some syntactically incorrect attempts (`.("age", ...)` or `.add(...)`) before correctly using `getPerson()["age"]`.
*   **6:53:35 PM - 6:56:11 PM**: Demonstration of modifying a dictionary value after retrieval, by assigning the function's return to a variable and updating `person["age"] = 39`.
*   **8:44:31 PM - 8:45:25 PM**: The `getPerson` function was updated to define its `person` dictionary locally, set its `age` to `40`, and then return it, with the output printed.
*   **8:45:51 PM**: The `person.pop("age")` method was introduced within `getPerson` to remove a key-value pair before the dictionary is returned.
*   **8:46:30 PM - 8:46:57 PM**: The `.get()` method was used inside `getPerson` to retrieve values with a "Not found" default, but these calls were not assigned or printed, indicating they might have been part of an exploration of the method's functionality rather than a change to the function's output.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**
*   **Consistent File Path**: All changes occurred in a single Python file, `c:\projects\Musoko-DSA-Series\Python\1. Two Sum.py`.
*   **Docstring Preservation**: The original docstring explaining the "Two Sum" problem remained untouched throughout all modifications, even when the underlying code completely changed its purpose.
*   **Iterative Development and Exploration**: The log shows a highly iterative development process with frequent, small commits, often testing syntax, debugging, or exploring different ways to achieve a task (e.g., accessing dictionary elements, handling missing keys).
*   **Heavy Use of Dictionaries**: Both the initial "Two Sum" solution and the subsequent Python object exploration extensively utilized dictionaries (named `map`, `person`, `data`).
*   **Commenting Out Code**: A significant pattern is the commenting out of the entire "Two Sum" function rather than deleting it, suggesting a shift in active development focus within the same file without discarding previous work.
