# Activity Summary for 2/15/2026

## 12:08:11 AM
The changes in the log exclusively pertain to the file `c:\projects\Musoko-DSA-Series\Python\1. Two Sum.py`.

The development of this file can be broadly categorized into two distinct phases, all occurring on **February 14, 2026**:

**Phase 1: Implementation and Refinement of the "Two Sum" Algorithm (3:42:33 PM - 3:56:22 PM)**
This initial period focused on solving the classic "Two Sum" problem.
*   **3:42:33 PM**: The first entry shows a complete Python `twoSum` function implementing a hash map approach to find two numbers that add up to a target, returning their indices.
*   **3:45:48 PM**: The function name was changed from `twoSum` to `twoSums`.
*   **3:46:19 PM - 3:49:28 PM**: The `twoSums` function was progressively re-implemented from an empty function, line by line, to mirror the original `twoSum` logic using `map = {}`, `enumerate`, `complement` calculation, conditional return, and storing `map[num] = i`. This suggests a potential refactoring or re-learning of the solution structure.
*   **3:54:40 PM - 3:56:22 PM**: Minor adjustments and debugging attempts were made to the return statement, briefly changing `return [map[complement], i]` to return `complement` or `num` directly before reverting to the correct index lookup. Test print statements were also added and corrected to call `twoSums`.

**Phase 2: Dictionary/Object Exploration (5:58:31 PM - 8:46:57 PM)**
Following a break, the code completely shifted focus. The previously implemented `twoSums` function was entirely commented out, and the file was repurposed for experimenting with Python dictionaries.
*   **5:58:31 PM - 6:00:32 PM**: The `twoSums` function was commented out, and a new, undefined function (`prs`, `person`, `human`) was briefly attempted before a `person` dictionary was directly defined.
*   **6:00:52 PM - 6:02:19 PM**: Initial attempts at accessing dictionary values using both direct key lookup (`person["name"]`) and the `.get()` method, including trying to access non-existent keys to observe behavior.
*   **6:03:06 PM - 6:03:55 PM**: Attempts were made to encapsulate dictionary access within a `getPerson` function, initially struggling with the correct syntax for returning values and printing the result.
*   **6:33:46 PM - 6:42:32 PM**: The `getPerson` function was refined to define and return a hardcoded dictionary (`{"name": "Collins", "age": 23, "email": "collins@gmail.com"}`). Extensive experimentation followed on how to call the function and retrieve specific values (e.g., `getPerson().get("name")`, `getPerson()["name"]`, `getPerson().get("password", "Does not exist")`).
*   **6:48:48 PM - 6:50:38 PM**: Further attempts to retrieve and interact with dictionary data, including some syntactically incorrect attempts (`.("age", ...)` or `.add(...)`) before correctly using `getPerson()["age"]`.
*   **6:53:35 PM - 6:56:11 PM**: Demonstration of modifying a dictionary value after retrieval, by assigning the function's return to a variable and updating `person["age"] = 39`.
*   **8:44:31 PM - 8:45:25 PM**: The `getPerson` function was updated to define its `person` dictionary locally, set its `age` to `40`, and then return it, with the output printed.
*   **8:45:51 PM**: The `person.pop("age")` method was introduced within `getPerson` to remove a key-value pair before the dictionary is returned.
*   **8:46:30 PM - 8:46:57 PM**: The `.get()` method was used inside `getPerson` to retrieve values with a "Not found" default, but these calls were not assigned or printed, indicating they might have been part of an exploration of the method's functionality rather than a change to the function's output.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**
*   **Consistent File Path**: All changes occurred in a single Python file, `c:\projects\Musoko-DSA-Series\Python\1. Two Sum.py`.
*   **Docstring Preservation**: The original docstring explaining the "Two Sum" problem remained untouched throughout all modifications, even when the underlying code completely changed its purpose.
*   **Iterative Development and Exploration**: The log shows a highly iterative development process with frequent, small commits, often testing syntax, debugging, or exploring different ways to achieve a task (e.g., accessing dictionary elements, handling missing keys).
*   **Heavy Use of Dictionaries**: Both the initial "Two Sum" solution and the subsequent Python object exploration extensively utilized dictionaries (named `map`, `person`, `data`).
*   **Commenting Out Code**: A significant pattern is the commenting out of the entire "Two Sum" function rather than deleting it, suggesting a shift in active development focus within the same file without discarding previous work.

## 2:08:19 AM
The log details a series of iterative changes to a single file, `c:\projects\Musoko-DSA-Series\Python\1. Two Sum.py`, all occurring on February 14, 2026, between 3:42 PM and 8:46 PM.

**File-Specific Updates (`c:\projects\Musoko-DSA-Series\Python\1. Two Sum.py`):**

The file initially contained an implementation for the "Two Sum" problem, a common data structure and algorithm question.
1.  **Initial Implementation (3:42 PM - 5:16 PM):**
    *   An initial `twoSum` function was implemented using a hash map to find two numbers that add up to a target, returning their indices.
    *   Shortly after, the function was renamed to `twoSums`.
    *   There were several small, incremental changes involving the re-construction and correction of the `twoSums` logic. This included adding the hash map (`map = {}`), iterating through the numbers (`for i, num in enumerate(nums):`), calculating the `complement`, checking if `complement` is in the map, and correctly returning `[map[complement], i]`.
    *   Briefly, there were incorrect attempts to return `[complement, i]` or `[complement, num]` (values instead of indices) before the correct `[map[complement], i]` was restored at 5:16 PM.
    *   Test print statements for `twoSums` were present, often commented out.

2.  **Shift to Dictionary Operations (5:58 PM - 8:46 PM):**
    *   Beginning around 5:58 PM, the `twoSums` function implementation was entirely commented out, indicating a significant shift in focus within the file.
    *   The remainder of the changes revolve around experimenting with Python dictionary operations:
        *   Defining a simple `person` dictionary (`{"name": "Jane", "age": 23, "is_female": True}`).
        *   Practicing accessing dictionary values using both bracket notation (`person["name"]`) and the `.get()` method (`person.get("name")`, `person.get("password")`, `person.get("password", "Does not exist")`).
        *   Developing a `getPerson` function which, in various iterations, either implicitly returned `None` while printing a dictionary, defined and returned a local dictionary, or demonstrated modifications to a dictionary.
        *   Experimenting with modifying dictionary values directly (`person["age"] = 39` or `person["age"] = 40`).
        *   Demonstrating dictionary key removal using `person.pop("age")`.
        *   Many small changes and syntax corrections were made during this phase as different dictionary operations were attempted and tested with `print` statements.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**
*   **2/14/2026, 3:42:33 PM:** Initial full implementation of the `twoSum` algorithm.
*   **2/14/2026, 3:45:48 PM:** Function name change from `twoSum` to `twoSums`.
*   **2/14/2026, 3:49:28 PM:** Completion of the correct hash map implementation for `twoSums` after iterative fixes.
*   **2/14/2026, 5:16:20 PM:** Final correction of the `twoSums` return statement to correctly yield indices.
*   **2/14/2026, 5:58:31 PM:** The `twoSums` function is commented out, marking a complete switch from DSA problem-solving to basic Python dictionary exploration.
*   **2/14/2026, 6:00:32 PM:** Introduction of the `person` dictionary example.
*   **2/14/2026, 6:42:32 PM:** A `getPerson` function is correctly structured to return a dictionary, and its values are accessed properly using `.get("name")`.
*   **2/14/2026, 6:53:45 PM:** Demonstration of modifying a dictionary value (`person["age"] = 39`) and printing the result.
*   **2/14/2026, 8:45:51 PM:** Demonstration of removing a key-value pair from a dictionary using `person.pop("age")`.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**
*   **Consistent Docstring:** The docstring at the top of the file describing the "Two Sum" problem remained unchanged throughout all modifications, even when the code shifted its focus completely.
*   **Commented Test Cases:** Test calls for the `twoSum`/`twoSums` function (e.g., `print(twoSum([2,7,11,15], 9))`) frequently appeared as commented-out lines, suggesting a pattern of local testing.
*   **Iterative Refinement:** Code was often built and corrected in small, rapid steps, indicated by many closely spaced timestamps with minor modifications (e.g., completing an incomplete line, fixing syntax errors, or adjusting return values).
*   **Educational/Exploratory Nature:** The drastic shift from a DSA problem to basic dictionary operations, coupled with the incremental testing and correction, suggests that the file was used for learning or experimenting with fundamental Python concepts.

## 5:08:08 AM
The log details changes exclusively within the file `c:\projects\Musoko-DSA-Series\Python\1. Two Sum.py`.

Initially, between **2/14/2026, 3:42:33 PM** and **3:56:22 PM**, the file focused on implementing the "Two Sum" problem.
*   A Python function `twoSum` was defined, which used a hash map (named `map`) to find two numbers in an array that sum to a target, returning their indices.
*   This function was subsequently renamed to `twoSums`. The implementation of `twoSums` was built incrementally, mimicking the logic of the original `twoSum` function, involving:
    *   Initializing an empty dictionary (`map`).
    *   Iterating through the input `nums` array.
    *   Calculating the `complement` (target - current number).
    *   Checking if the `complement` exists in the `map`. If so, returning the indices.
    *   Storing the current number and its index in the `map`.
*   Testing lines using `print(twoSums([2,7,11,15], 9))` were added and uncommented. Brief attempts to return `[complement, i]` or `[complement, num]` instead of `[map[complement], i]` were made but reverted, maintaining the correct hash map lookup.

A significant shift occurred around **2/14/2026, 5:58:31 PM**. The entire `twoSums` function implementation and its test calls were commented out. The file's purpose then transitioned to experimenting with basic Python dictionary operations:
*   Several incomplete function definitions (`def prs`, `def person`, `def human`) appeared briefly, indicating initial exploration.
*   From **2/14/2026, 6:00:32 PM** onwards, a `person` dictionary was introduced (`{"name": "Jane", "age": 23, "is_female": True}`).
*   This was followed by demonstrations of accessing dictionary values using both direct key access (e.g., `person["name"]`) and the `.get()` method (e.g., `person.get("password")`), specifically highlighting how `.get()` can prevent `KeyError` for non-existent keys.
*   A new function `getPerson()` was developed, starting around **2/14/2026, 6:03:06 PM**. This function was refined to return a fixed dictionary (`{"name": "Collins", "age": 23, "email": "collins@gmail.com"}`).
*   Subsequent changes (until **2/14/2026, 8:49:09 PM**) continued to demonstrate dictionary manipulation through the `getPerson()` function:
    *   Accessing values returned by `getPerson()` using both `["key"]` (e.g., `getPerson()["name"]`) and `.get("key", default_value)` (e.g., `getPerson().get("password", "Does not exist")`).
    *   Modifying dictionary values (e.g., `person["age"] = 39`).
    *   Removing items using `.pop()` (e.g., `person.pop("age")`).

The recurring pattern is a shift from solving a specific Data Structures and Algorithms problem ("Two Sum") to exploring and demonstrating fundamental Python dictionary functionalities and methods, with the initial problem's code being entirely commented out in the later stages. Most changes involve small, iterative additions or modifications to test dictionary behavior.

## 6:08:12 AM
The log details changes to a single file: `c:\projects\Musoko-DSA-Series\Python\1. Two Sum.py`. The modifications occurred on **2/14/2026** across several hours.

**File-Specific Updates (`c:\projects\Musoko-DSA-Series\Python\1. Two Sum.py`):**

The file initially contained and iteratively developed a Python function named `twoSum` (later renamed `twoSums`).

*   **Early afternoon (3:42 PM - 5:16 PM):**
    *   The `twoSum` function was introduced and refined, aiming to solve the "Two Sum" problem using a hash map approach.
    *   Initial implementation at **3:42:33 PM** included the core logic for finding complements and storing numbers and their indices in a map.
    *   The function name was changed to `twoSums` around **3:45:48 PM**.
    *   The implementation details, including the loop, calculating the `complement`, checking its presence in the map, and returning indices, were built up progressively between **3:46 PM** and **3:49 PM**.
    *   Around **3:56 PM**, temporary bugs were introduced where `complement` or `num` (values) were incorrectly returned instead of their `map` indices.
    *   By **5:16:20 PM**, the `twoSums` function was corrected to return `[map[complement], i]`, indicating the correct indices.

*   **Later afternoon/Evening (5:58 PM - 8:46 PM):**
    *   A significant shift occurred around **5:58:31 PM** when the `twoSums` function and its associated print statements were almost entirely commented out.
    *   The focus then moved to demonstrating Python dictionary operations. Initial attempts to define functions like `prs`, `person`, `human` were made but quickly abandoned or commented out.
    *   A `person` dictionary was defined at **6:00:32 PM** (`{"name": "Jane", "age": 23, "is_female": True}`).
    *   Subsequent changes (from **6:00 PM to 6:02 PM**) explored accessing dictionary elements using both bracket notation (`person["name"]`) and the safer `person.get("key")` method.
    *   A new function `getPerson` was introduced around **6:03:06 PM** to encapsulate dictionary creation and retrieval. This function was iteratively refined.
    *   Between **6:33 PM** and **6:41 PM**, there were multiple attempts to properly define `getPerson` (initially with parameters, then without) and call it to retrieve specific dictionary values, often resulting in syntax errors or incorrect method calls.
    *   The correct pattern for calling `getPerson` and accessing its returned dictionary was established around **6:42:32 PM** with `print(getPerson().get("name"))`.
    *   Further experiments (from **6:46 PM to 6:50 PM**) demonstrated accessing values directly (`getPerson()["name"]`) and using `get()` with a default fallback value (`getPerson().get("password", "Does not exist")`).
    *   Dictionary modification was shown at **6:53:45 PM** by retrieving the dictionary, updating a value, and printing it (`person = getPerson(); person["age"] = 39; print(person)`).
    *   In the final series of changes (around **8:45 PM**), the `getPerson` function was modified to internally create, potentially modify (e.g., `person["age"] = 40`), or attempt to remove (e.g., `person.pop("age")` at **8:45:51 PM**) items from a dictionary before returning it. The last relevant change at **8:46:57 PM** showed `person.get("password","Not found")` inside `getPerson`, though `get()` itself does not modify the dictionary.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Iterative Refinement:** Both the `twoSums` function and the dictionary manipulation examples exhibit a strong pattern of iterative development, where code is incrementally added, tested (often with `print` statements), corrected, and refined across multiple commits within a short timeframe.
*   **Problem-Solving Focus:** The file serves as a scratchpad for solving specific programming problems or exploring language features. It shifted from a Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problem ("Two Sum") to fundamental Python dictionary operations.
*   **Commenting out unused code:** The initial `twoSums` solution was almost entirely commented out rather than deleted, suggesting it might be revisited or kept for reference.
*   **Consistent Docstring/Comment:** The problem description for "Two Sum" remained at the top of the file as a multi-line string comment throughout all changes, even when the code below it no longer directly addressed that problem. This indicates the primary purpose or context of the file.
*   **Testing with `print` statements:** Frequent use of `print()` statements to verify intermediate steps or final outputs of functions and dictionary operations.

## 8:08:09 AM
The log primarily details extensive changes to a single file: `c:\projects\Musoko-DSA-Series\Python\1. Two Sum.py`.

**File-Specific Updates (`c:\projects\Musoko-DSA-Series\Python\1. Two Sum.py`)**:

*   **Early Development (2/14/2026, 3:42 PM - 3:56 PM):**
    *   Initially, a Python function `twoSum` was defined, implementing the "Two Sum" problem using a hash map approach to find indices of two numbers that add up to a target.
    *   Soon after, the body of `twoSum` was removed, and then the function was progressively re-implemented under the name `twoSums`. This re-implementation closely mirrored the original logic, using a `map` (dictionary) to store numbers and their indices, calculating a `complement`, and returning indices `[map[complement], i]` when found.
    *   During this phase, there were also small corrections to the return value (e.g., `[complement, i]` briefly, then `[complement, num]`, before settling back to `[map[complement], i]`) and testing via `print` statements.

*   **Shift in Focus & Extensive Python Dictionary/Function Experimentation (2/14/2026, 5:58 PM - 8:46 PM):**
    *   **Major Change:** All the code related to the `twoSums` function (the function definition itself and its commented-out test calls) was commented out. This marks a clear pivot away from the "Two Sum" problem.
    *   **Introduction of `person` dictionary and `getPerson` function:** The file then became a scratchpad for experimenting with Python dictionaries and functions.
        *   Early attempts involved defining placeholder functions like `prs`, `person`, `human`, before a `person` dictionary was directly created.
        *   Extensive logging (using `print`) was performed to test various ways of accessing dictionary elements (`person["key"]`, `person.get("key")`), including handling non-existent keys (`person.get("password")`).
        *   A function named `getPerson` was developed iteratively. Initially, it involved returning `person.get()` or `person.get("name")`.
        *   The `person` dictionary (later renamed `data`) was eventually encapsulated within the `getPerson` function.
        *   The dictionary content was updated to include `"name": "Collins", "age": 23, "email": "collins@gmail.com"`.
        *   Numerous attempts were made to correctly call `getPerson` and access its returned dictionary's values (e.g., `getPerson().get("name")`, `getPerson()["name"]`).
        *   Further experiments included modifying a dictionary returned by `getPerson` (e.g., `person["age"] = 39`), using `pop` to remove items, and employing `get` with a default value to safely access keys (e.g., `get("password", "Not found")`).

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **2/14/2026, 3:42:33 PM:** Initial complete `twoSum` function.
*   **2/14/2026, 3:42:43 PM:** `twoSum` function body removed.
*   **2/14/2026, 3:45:48 PM - 3:49:28 PM:** Gradual re-implementation of the "Two Sum" logic as `twoSums`.
*   **2/14/2026, 5:58:31 PM:** `twoSums` function fully commented out, beginning of new experimentation.
*   **2/14/2026, 6:00:32 PM:** Introduction of the `person` dictionary.
*   **2/14/2026, 6:03:06 PM - 6:42:32 PM:** Development and refinement of the `getPerson` function and its dictionary interaction, including encapsulating the dictionary within the function and correct access patterns.
*   **2/14/2026, 6:53:35 PM - 8:46:57 PM:** Further exploration of dictionary manipulation (modifying, popping, safe `get` with default).

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Iterative Development:** The code shows a clear pattern of incremental changes, often adding one line or a small block of code, then attempting to run or print results, and then correcting or refining the syntax. This is evident in the re-implementation of `twoSums` and the development of `getPerson`.
*   **Commenting Out Old Code:** Instead of deleting, previous code (like the `twoSums` implementation) was extensively commented out when shifting focus to new exercises.
*   **Debugging/Experimentation via `print` statements:** Many changes involve modifying `print` statements to test different ways of calling functions or accessing dictionary elements, indicating an exploratory coding style.
*   **Focus on Python Dictionary Operations:** The latter half of the log is almost entirely dedicated to understanding and demonstrating dictionary creation, access (`[]` vs. `get()`), modification, and deletion (`pop`).
*   **Docstring Consistency:** The initial docstring for the "Two Sum" problem remains at the top of the file throughout all changes, even when the active code no longer pertains to that problem.

## 9:08:10 AM
The log details continuous modifications within a single file: `c:\projects\Musoko-DSA-Series\Python\1. Two Sum.py`, all occurring on 2/14/2026.

**File-Specific Updates (`c:\projects\Musoko-DSA-Series\Python\1. Two Sum.py`):**

The file's content evolves through two distinct phases:

1.  **Initial "Two Sum" Problem Implementation (3:42:33 PM - 5:16:20 PM):**
    *   The file begins with a Python function `twoSum` designed to solve the "Two Sum" problem using a hash map (dictionary).
    *   Shortly after its initial definition (3:42:33 PM), the function's body is briefly removed (3:42:43 PM), then gradually re-implemented under the name `twoSums` (starting 3:45:48 PM and completing by 3:49:28 PM). This re-implementation includes setting up a dictionary, iterating through numbers, calculating the complement, checking if the complement exists in the dictionary, returning indices if found, and storing the current number and its index in the dictionary.
    *   There were a few minor corrections and debugging attempts related to the return value (e.g., trying `[complement, i]` instead of `[map[complement], i]`) between 3:56:08 PM and 5:16:20 PM, eventually settling on the correct implementation.
    *   Test print statements for the `twoSums` function were also uncommented and adjusted during this period.

2.  **Transition to Python Dictionary and Function Basics (5:58:31 PM - 8:46:57 PM):**
    *   After 5:16:20 PM, the existing `twoSums` function is entirely commented out (5:58:31 PM).
    *   The file then shifts to exploring fundamental Python concepts, primarily focusing on dictionaries and functions:
        *   There are several transient attempts to define new functions like `prs`, `person`, and `human`, which are quickly discarded or refined.
        *   A `person` dictionary is defined (`{"name": "Jane", "age": 23, "is_female": True}`) (6:00:32 PM).
        *   Subsequent changes involve various ways of accessing dictionary elements (e.g., `person["name"]`, `person.get("password")`, `person.get("name")`) and handling missing keys with `.get()`.
        *   A `getPerson` function is introduced, initially struggling with how to return dictionary data or access it correctly from within the function (6:03:06 PM - 6:41:51 PM).
        *   The `getPerson` function is refined to consistently return a dictionary containing `"name"`, `"age"`, and `"email"` (6:41:24 PM onwards).
        *   Further changes demonstrate accessing specific values from the dictionary returned by `getPerson()` (e.g., `getPerson().get("name")`, `getPerson()["name"]`), and attempting to modify dictionary elements (`person["age"] = 39`) or use dictionary methods like `pop()` and `get()` on the dictionary *before* it's returned by `getPerson()` (8:45:10 PM - 8:46:57 PM).

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **2/14/2026, 3:42:33 PM:** Initial complete implementation of the `twoSum` function.
*   **2/14/2026, 3:45:48 PM - 3:49:28 PM:** Gradual re-implementation and renaming of the `twoSum` logic to `twoSums`.
*   **2/14/2026, 5:58:31 PM:** The `twoSums` function is entirely commented out, marking a complete shift in the file's purpose.
*   **2/14/2026, 6:00:32 PM:** Introduction of the `person` dictionary, beginning the exploration of dictionary fundamentals.
*   **2/14/2026, 6:42:32 PM:** Stabilization of the `getPerson` function to return a dictionary, with correct usage of `.get()` for access.
*   **2/14/2026, 6:53:45 PM:** Demonstration of modifying a dictionary returned by a function.
*   **2/14/2026, 8:45:51 PM - 8:46:57 PM:** Exploration of dictionary methods like `pop()` and `get()` within the `getPerson` function before returning the dictionary.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements in the Content:**

*   **Consistent Docstring:** The docstring describing the "Two Sum" problem remains at the top of the file throughout all changes, even when the actual "Two Sum" code is commented out.
*   **Commented-out Test Calls:** Commented-out `print(twoSum([...]))` or `print(twoSums([...]))` lines persist at the bottom of the file as placeholders for testing, even after the focus shifts away from the "Two Sum" problem.
*   **Iterative Development/Learning:** The changes show a clear pattern of iterative development, where code is gradually built, debugged, commented out, and new concepts are explored step-by-step, often involving partially written lines or immediate corrections. This suggests the file is being used as a live scratchpad for learning or experimenting with Python syntax and data structures.
*   **Focus on Dictionaries:** A strong recurring theme in the later timestamps is the detailed exploration of Python dictionaries: creation, element access (`[]` vs. `.get()`), modification, and methods (`pop()`).

## 10:08:12 AM
The provided log details a series of changes made exclusively to the file `c:\projects\Musoko-DSA-Series\Python\1. Two Sum.py` on February 14, 2026. The modifications show a progression from implementing a classic data structures and algorithms problem to exploring fundamental Python dictionary operations and function definitions.

**File-Specific Updates (`c:\projects\Musoko-DSA-Series\Python\1. Two Sum.py`):**

*   **Initial Implementation (3:42 PM):** The file began with a complete Python solution for the "Two Sum" problem, using a hash map (dictionary) to find indices of two numbers that sum to a target. The function was named `twoSum`.
*   **Function Renaming and Re-implementation (3:42 PM - 3:49 PM):** Shortly after, the `twoSum` function's body was removed. A new function, `twoSums`, was then progressively built out, step-by-step, to recreate the logic of the original `twoSum` solution. This involved initializing a map, iterating through numbers, calculating the complement, checking if the complement exists in the map, returning indices, and finally storing the current number and its index in the map.
*   **Testing and Debugging `twoSums` (3:54 PM - 5:16 PM):** Following the re-implementation, several minor adjustments and print statements were added to test the `twoSums` function. There were a few temporary attempts to return incorrect values (e.g., `[complement, i]` instead of `[map[complement], i]`) which were quickly corrected.
*   **Shift to Dictionary/Function Experimentation (5:58 PM - 6:03 PM):** A significant change occurred where the entire `twoSums` function (along with its test calls) was commented out. The focus shifted dramatically to experimenting with Python dictionaries and functions. Initial attempts included incomplete function definitions (`def prs`, `def person`, `def human`) before a `person` dictionary was successfully defined. This was followed by attempts to access its elements, including handling missing keys using `.get()`.
*   **Refactoring into `getPerson` Function (6:03 PM - 6:42 PM):** The `person` dictionary was then encapsulated within a function called `getPerson`. This function was refined to return the dictionary, and experimentation continued on how to call the function and access specific keys from the returned dictionary, often with trial-and-error syntax.
*   **Advanced Dictionary Operations (6:45 PM - 8:46 PM):** The final set of changes involved more advanced dictionary manipulations within the context of the `getPerson` function. This included:
    *   Accessing dictionary elements directly (`["key"]`) and using `.get()` with a default value for non-existent keys.
    *   Attempting erroneous dictionary methods like `.add()`.
    *   Modifying a dictionary returned by `getPerson()` (e.g., `person["age"] = 39`).
    *   Incorporating dictionary methods like `.pop()` to remove elements and `.get()` to retrieve elements within the `getPerson` function itself before returning the modified dictionary.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **2/14/2026, 3:42 PM:** Initial complete `twoSum` function.
*   **2/14/2026, 3:45 PM - 3:49 PM:** Gradual re-implementation of the `twoSums` function.
*   **2/14/2026, 5:58 PM:** The `twoSums` implementation is fully commented out, marking the transition to new, unrelated code (dictionary experiments).
*   **2/14/2026, 6:00 PM:** Introduction of the `person` dictionary.
*   **2/14/2026, 6:03 PM:** Introduction of the `getPerson` function encapsulating dictionary data.
*   **2/14/2026, 6:53 PM:** Demonstrating mutable behavior of dictionaries returned by a function.
*   **2/14/2026, 8:44 PM - 8:46 PM:** Further experimentation with dictionary modifications (pop, get) inside the `getPerson` function.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Consistent File Path:** All changes were confined to a single Python file, indicating focused work on that specific file.
*   **Docstring Persistence:** The "Two Sum" problem's docstring remained at the top of the file throughout all modifications, even when the actual `twoSum` or `twoSums` implementation was commented out or replaced by unrelated code.
*   **Commented-out Test Calls:** The lines `print(twoSum([2,7,11,15], 9))` and `print(twoSum([4,8,3,5, 7], 10))` were consistently present, although often commented out, serving as historical remnants or potential future test cases.
*   **Iterative Development:** There's a clear pattern of incremental changes, often with partially written lines or syntax errors that are quickly corrected in subsequent timestamps. This suggests an interactive development or learning process.
*   **Context Switching:** The log shows a distinct shift in context from solving a DSA problem to exploring basic Python language features (dictionaries, functions, accessing/modifying data).

## 11:08:13 AM
The log details continuous development activity within the file `c:\projects\Musoko-DSA-Series\Python\1. Two Sum.py` on February 14, 2026, showcasing two distinct phases of work.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\projects\Musoko-DSA-Series\Python\1. Two Sum.py`**:
    *   **Initial Phase (3:42 PM - 5:16 PM):** The file began with an implementation of the "Two Sum" Data Structures and Algorithms problem, using a `twoSum` function that leveraged a hash map (Python dictionary) to store numbers and their indices for efficient lookup.
        *   At 3:42:33 PM, the `twoSum` function was present with its core logic.
        *   By 3:42:43 PM, the `twoSum` function definition was removed.
        *   Between 3:45:48 PM and 3:49:28 PM, the "Two Sum" logic was progressively re-implemented under a new function named `twoSums`, mirroring the previous `twoSum`'s hash map approach.
        *   Minor debugging and correction of the return statement in `twoSums` occurred around 3:56 PM, specifically changing how indices/values were returned, before being finalized to `return [map[complement], i]` by 5:16:20 PM.
    *   **Shift in Focus (5:58 PM - 8:47 PM):** A significant change occurred around 5:58:31 PM, where the entire `twoSums` function and its test calls were commented out. The file then transitioned to exploring fundamental Python dictionary (map) operations and syntax.
        *   From 6:00:32 PM, code snippets introduced and manipulated a `person` dictionary, demonstrating key access (`person["name"]`), safe retrieval with `get()` (`person.get("age")`), and later, attempting to wrap this in functions.
        *   Between 6:33:46 PM and 6:42:32 PM, a `getPerson()` function was developed, initially taking arguments, but then revised to be argument-less, returning a dictionary. Subsequent `print` statements demonstrated calling this function and using `.get("key")` on its returned value.
        *   Further exploration involved using `get()` with a default value for non-existent keys (e.g., `getPerson().get("password", "Does not exist")` at 6:48:02 PM).
        *   Later changes, from 6:53:35 PM to 8:46:57 PM, showed modifying dictionary values (`person["age"] = 39`), removing elements using `pop()` (`person.pop("age")`), and repeatedly testing `get()` method behavior.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **2/14/2026, 3:42:33 PM:** Initial full implementation of `twoSum`.
*   **2/14/2026, 3:45:48 PM:** Introduction of `twoSums` function, signifying a refactoring or restart of the "Two Sum" problem.
*   **2/14/2026, 3:49:28 PM:** Completion of the `twoSums` function with correct logic.
*   **2/14/2026, 5:58:31 PM:** The "Two Sum" problem code is commented out, marking a pivot to a new topic.
*   **2/14/2026, 6:00:32 PM:** Introduction of the `person` dictionary and initial dictionary manipulation.
*   **2/14/2026, 6:42:32 PM:** `getPerson()` function is well-defined to return a dictionary, and its usage with `get()` is demonstrated correctly.
*   **2/14/2026, 6:48:02 PM:** Demonstration of `get()` with a default value for non-existent keys.
*   **2/14/2026, 8:45:51 PM:** Introduction of `pop()` method for removing dictionary items.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Single File Development:** All changes were confined to a single Python file, suggesting a focused learning or prototyping environment.
*   **Commenting Out Old Code:** A strong pattern observed is the tendency to comment out previous working (or recently worked on) code blocks, such as the `twoSums` function, instead of deleting them entirely. This indicates an exploratory development style, preserving prior work while moving on to new concepts.
*   **Python Dictionary Exploration:** The latter half of the log shows a recurring theme of experimenting with various dictionary functionalities: creation, access, modification, deletion, and method usage (`get`, `pop`). This suggests a deep dive into understanding how Python dictionaries work.
*   **Incremental Progress:** Changes often involve small additions or corrections in rapid succession, especially when rebuilding the `twoSums` function or experimenting with dictionary access.
