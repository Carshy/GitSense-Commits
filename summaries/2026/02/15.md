# Activity Summary for 2/15/2026

## 12:08:11 AM
The changes in the log exclusively pertain to the file `c:\projects\Musoko-DSA-Series\Python\1. Two Sum.py`.

The development of this file can be broadly categorized into two distinct phases, all occurring on **February 14, 2026**:

**Phase 1: Implementation and Refinement of the "Two Sum" Algorithm (3:42:33 PM - 3:56:22 PM)**
This initial period focused on solving the classic "Two Sum" problem.
*   **3:42:33 PM**: The first entry shows a complete Python `twoSum` function implementing a hash map approach to find two numbers that add up to a target, returning their indices.
*   **3:45:48 PM**: The function name was changed from `twoSum` to `twoSums`.
*   **3:46:19 PM - 3:49:28 PM**: The `twoSums` function was progressively re-implemented from an empty function, line by line, to mirror the original `twoSum` logic using `map = {}`, `enumerate`, `complement` calculation, conditional return, and storing `map[num] = i`. This suggests a potential refactoring or re-learning of the solution structure.
*   **3:54:40 PM - 3:56:22 PM**: Minor adjustments and debugging attempts were made to the return statement, briefly changing `return [map[complement], i]` to return `complement` or `num` directly before reverting to the correct index lookup. Test print statements were also added and corrected to call `twoSums`.

**Phase 2: Dictionary/Object Exploration (5:58:31 PM - 8:46:57 PM)**
Following a break, the code completely shifted focus. The previously implemented `twoSums` function was entirely commented out, and the file was repurposed for experimenting with Python dictionaries.
*   **5:58:31 PM - 6:00:32 PM**: The `twoSums` function was commented out, and a new, undefined function (`prs`, `person`, `human`) was briefly attempted before a `person` dictionary was directly defined.
*   **6:00:52 PM - 6:02:19 PM**: Initial attempts at accessing dictionary values using both direct key lookup (`person["name"]`) and the `.get()` method, including trying to access non-existent keys to observe behavior.
*   **6:03:06 PM - 6:03:55 PM**: Attempts were made to encapsulate dictionary access within a `getPerson` function, initially struggling with the correct syntax for returning values and printing the result.
*   **6:33:46 PM - 6:42:32 PM**: The `getPerson` function was refined to define and return a hardcoded dictionary (`{"name": "Collins", "age": 23, "email": "collins@gmail.com"}`). Extensive experimentation followed on how to call the function and retrieve specific values (e.g., `getPerson().get("name")`, `getPerson()["name"]`, `getPerson().get("password", "Does not exist")`).
*   **6:48:48 PM - 6:50:38 PM**: Further attempts to retrieve and interact with dictionary data, including some syntactically incorrect attempts (`.("age", ...)` or `.add(...)`) before correctly using `getPerson()["age"]`.
*   **6:53:35 PM - 6:56:11 PM**: Demonstration of modifying a dictionary value after retrieval, by assigning the function's return to a variable and updating `person["age"] = 39`.
*   **8:44:31 PM - 8:45:25 PM**: The `getPerson` function was updated to define its `person` dictionary locally, set its `age` to `40`, and then return it, with the output printed.
*   **8:45:51 PM**: The `person.pop("age")` method was introduced within `getPerson` to remove a key-value pair before the dictionary is returned.
*   **8:46:30 PM - 8:46:57 PM**: The `.get()` method was used inside `getPerson` to retrieve values with a "Not found" default, but these calls were not assigned or printed, indicating they might have been part of an exploration of the method's functionality rather than a change to the function's output.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**
*   **Consistent File Path**: All changes occurred in a single Python file, `c:\projects\Musoko-DSA-Series\Python\1. Two Sum.py`.
*   **Docstring Preservation**: The original docstring explaining the "Two Sum" problem remained untouched throughout all modifications, even when the underlying code completely changed its purpose.
*   **Iterative Development and Exploration**: The log shows a highly iterative development process with frequent, small commits, often testing syntax, debugging, or exploring different ways to achieve a task (e.g., accessing dictionary elements, handling missing keys).
*   **Heavy Use of Dictionaries**: Both the initial "Two Sum" solution and the subsequent Python object exploration extensively utilized dictionaries (named `map`, `person`, `data`).
*   **Commenting Out Code**: A significant pattern is the commenting out of the entire "Two Sum" function rather than deleting it, suggesting a shift in active development focus within the same file without discarding previous work.

## 2:08:19 AM
The log details a series of iterative changes to a single file, `c:\projects\Musoko-DSA-Series\Python\1. Two Sum.py`, all occurring on February 14, 2026, between 3:42 PM and 8:46 PM.

**File-Specific Updates (`c:\projects\Musoko-DSA-Series\Python\1. Two Sum.py`):**

The file initially contained an implementation for the "Two Sum" problem, a common data structure and algorithm question.
1.  **Initial Implementation (3:42 PM - 5:16 PM):**
    *   An initial `twoSum` function was implemented using a hash map to find two numbers that add up to a target, returning their indices.
    *   Shortly after, the function was renamed to `twoSums`.
    *   There were several small, incremental changes involving the re-construction and correction of the `twoSums` logic. This included adding the hash map (`map = {}`), iterating through the numbers (`for i, num in enumerate(nums):`), calculating the `complement`, checking if `complement` is in the map, and correctly returning `[map[complement], i]`.
    *   Briefly, there were incorrect attempts to return `[complement, i]` or `[complement, num]` (values instead of indices) before the correct `[map[complement], i]` was restored at 5:16 PM.
    *   Test print statements for `twoSums` were present, often commented out.

2.  **Shift to Dictionary Operations (5:58 PM - 8:46 PM):**
    *   Beginning around 5:58 PM, the `twoSums` function implementation was entirely commented out, indicating a significant shift in focus within the file.
    *   The remainder of the changes revolve around experimenting with Python dictionary operations:
        *   Defining a simple `person` dictionary (`{"name": "Jane", "age": 23, "is_female": True}`).
        *   Practicing accessing dictionary values using both bracket notation (`person["name"]`) and the `.get()` method (`person.get("name")`, `person.get("password")`, `person.get("password", "Does not exist")`).
        *   Developing a `getPerson` function which, in various iterations, either implicitly returned `None` while printing a dictionary, defined and returned a local dictionary, or demonstrated modifications to a dictionary.
        *   Experimenting with modifying dictionary values directly (`person["age"] = 39` or `person["age"] = 40`).
        *   Demonstrating dictionary key removal using `person.pop("age")`.
        *   Many small changes and syntax corrections were made during this phase as different dictionary operations were attempted and tested with `print` statements.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**
*   **2/14/2026, 3:42:33 PM:** Initial full implementation of the `twoSum` algorithm.
*   **2/14/2026, 3:45:48 PM:** Function name change from `twoSum` to `twoSums`.
*   **2/14/2026, 3:49:28 PM:** Completion of the correct hash map implementation for `twoSums` after iterative fixes.
*   **2/14/2026, 5:16:20 PM:** Final correction of the `twoSums` return statement to correctly yield indices.
*   **2/14/2026, 5:58:31 PM:** The `twoSums` function is commented out, marking a complete switch from DSA problem-solving to basic Python dictionary exploration.
*   **2/14/2026, 6:00:32 PM:** Introduction of the `person` dictionary example.
*   **2/14/2026, 6:42:32 PM:** A `getPerson` function is correctly structured to return a dictionary, and its values are accessed properly using `.get("name")`.
*   **2/14/2026, 6:53:45 PM:** Demonstration of modifying a dictionary value (`person["age"] = 39`) and printing the result.
*   **2/14/2026, 8:45:51 PM:** Demonstration of removing a key-value pair from a dictionary using `person.pop("age")`.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**
*   **Consistent Docstring:** The docstring at the top of the file describing the "Two Sum" problem remained unchanged throughout all modifications, even when the code shifted its focus completely.
*   **Commented Test Cases:** Test calls for the `twoSum`/`twoSums` function (e.g., `print(twoSum([2,7,11,15], 9))`) frequently appeared as commented-out lines, suggesting a pattern of local testing.
*   **Iterative Refinement:** Code was often built and corrected in small, rapid steps, indicated by many closely spaced timestamps with minor modifications (e.g., completing an incomplete line, fixing syntax errors, or adjusting return values).
*   **Educational/Exploratory Nature:** The drastic shift from a DSA problem to basic dictionary operations, coupled with the incremental testing and correction, suggests that the file was used for learning or experimenting with fundamental Python concepts.
