# Activity Summary for 2/15/2026

## 12:08:11 AM
The changes in the log exclusively pertain to the file `c:\projects\Musoko-DSA-Series\Python\1. Two Sum.py`.

The development of this file can be broadly categorized into two distinct phases, all occurring on **February 14, 2026**:

**Phase 1: Implementation and Refinement of the "Two Sum" Algorithm (3:42:33 PM - 3:56:22 PM)**
This initial period focused on solving the classic "Two Sum" problem.
*   **3:42:33 PM**: The first entry shows a complete Python `twoSum` function implementing a hash map approach to find two numbers that add up to a target, returning their indices.
*   **3:45:48 PM**: The function name was changed from `twoSum` to `twoSums`.
*   **3:46:19 PM - 3:49:28 PM**: The `twoSums` function was progressively re-implemented from an empty function, line by line, to mirror the original `twoSum` logic using `map = {}`, `enumerate`, `complement` calculation, conditional return, and storing `map[num] = i`. This suggests a potential refactoring or re-learning of the solution structure.
*   **3:54:40 PM - 3:56:22 PM**: Minor adjustments and debugging attempts were made to the return statement, briefly changing `return [map[complement], i]` to return `complement` or `num` directly before reverting to the correct index lookup. Test print statements were also added and corrected to call `twoSums`.

**Phase 2: Dictionary/Object Exploration (5:58:31 PM - 8:46:57 PM)**
Following a break, the code completely shifted focus. The previously implemented `twoSums` function was entirely commented out, and the file was repurposed for experimenting with Python dictionaries.
*   **5:58:31 PM - 6:00:32 PM**: The `twoSums` function was commented out, and a new, undefined function (`prs`, `person`, `human`) was briefly attempted before a `person` dictionary was directly defined.
*   **6:00:52 PM - 6:02:19 PM**: Initial attempts at accessing dictionary values using both direct key lookup (`person["name"]`) and the `.get()` method, including trying to access non-existent keys to observe behavior.
*   **6:03:06 PM - 6:03:55 PM**: Attempts were made to encapsulate dictionary access within a `getPerson` function, initially struggling with the correct syntax for returning values and printing the result.
*   **6:33:46 PM - 6:42:32 PM**: The `getPerson` function was refined to define and return a hardcoded dictionary (`{"name": "Collins", "age": 23, "email": "collins@gmail.com"}`). Extensive experimentation followed on how to call the function and retrieve specific values (e.g., `getPerson().get("name")`, `getPerson()["name"]`, `getPerson().get("password", "Does not exist")`).
*   **6:48:48 PM - 6:50:38 PM**: Further attempts to retrieve and interact with dictionary data, including some syntactically incorrect attempts (`.("age", ...)` or `.add(...)`) before correctly using `getPerson()["age"]`.
*   **6:53:35 PM - 6:56:11 PM**: Demonstration of modifying a dictionary value after retrieval, by assigning the function's return to a variable and updating `person["age"] = 39`.
*   **8:44:31 PM - 8:45:25 PM**: The `getPerson` function was updated to define its `person` dictionary locally, set its `age` to `40`, and then return it, with the output printed.
*   **8:45:51 PM**: The `person.pop("age")` method was introduced within `getPerson` to remove a key-value pair before the dictionary is returned.
*   **8:46:30 PM - 8:46:57 PM**: The `.get()` method was used inside `getPerson` to retrieve values with a "Not found" default, but these calls were not assigned or printed, indicating they might have been part of an exploration of the method's functionality rather than a change to the function's output.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**
*   **Consistent File Path**: All changes occurred in a single Python file, `c:\projects\Musoko-DSA-Series\Python\1. Two Sum.py`.
*   **Docstring Preservation**: The original docstring explaining the "Two Sum" problem remained untouched throughout all modifications, even when the underlying code completely changed its purpose.
*   **Iterative Development and Exploration**: The log shows a highly iterative development process with frequent, small commits, often testing syntax, debugging, or exploring different ways to achieve a task (e.g., accessing dictionary elements, handling missing keys).
*   **Heavy Use of Dictionaries**: Both the initial "Two Sum" solution and the subsequent Python object exploration extensively utilized dictionaries (named `map`, `person`, `data`).
*   **Commenting Out Code**: A significant pattern is the commenting out of the entire "Two Sum" function rather than deleting it, suggesting a shift in active development focus within the same file without discarding previous work.

## 2:08:19 AM
The log details a series of iterative changes to a single file, `c:\projects\Musoko-DSA-Series\Python\1. Two Sum.py`, all occurring on February 14, 2026, between 3:42 PM and 8:46 PM.

**File-Specific Updates (`c:\projects\Musoko-DSA-Series\Python\1. Two Sum.py`):**

The file initially contained an implementation for the "Two Sum" problem, a common data structure and algorithm question.
1.  **Initial Implementation (3:42 PM - 5:16 PM):**
    *   An initial `twoSum` function was implemented using a hash map to find two numbers that add up to a target, returning their indices.
    *   Shortly after, the function was renamed to `twoSums`.
    *   There were several small, incremental changes involving the re-construction and correction of the `twoSums` logic. This included adding the hash map (`map = {}`), iterating through the numbers (`for i, num in enumerate(nums):`), calculating the `complement`, checking if `complement` is in the map, and correctly returning `[map[complement], i]`.
    *   Briefly, there were incorrect attempts to return `[complement, i]` or `[complement, num]` (values instead of indices) before the correct `[map[complement], i]` was restored at 5:16 PM.
    *   Test print statements for `twoSums` were present, often commented out.

2.  **Shift to Dictionary Operations (5:58 PM - 8:46 PM):**
    *   Beginning around 5:58 PM, the `twoSums` function implementation was entirely commented out, indicating a significant shift in focus within the file.
    *   The remainder of the changes revolve around experimenting with Python dictionary operations:
        *   Defining a simple `person` dictionary (`{"name": "Jane", "age": 23, "is_female": True}`).
        *   Practicing accessing dictionary values using both bracket notation (`person["name"]`) and the `.get()` method (`person.get("name")`, `person.get("password")`, `person.get("password", "Does not exist")`).
        *   Developing a `getPerson` function which, in various iterations, either implicitly returned `None` while printing a dictionary, defined and returned a local dictionary, or demonstrated modifications to a dictionary.
        *   Experimenting with modifying dictionary values directly (`person["age"] = 39` or `person["age"] = 40`).
        *   Demonstrating dictionary key removal using `person.pop("age")`.
        *   Many small changes and syntax corrections were made during this phase as different dictionary operations were attempted and tested with `print` statements.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**
*   **2/14/2026, 3:42:33 PM:** Initial full implementation of the `twoSum` algorithm.
*   **2/14/2026, 3:45:48 PM:** Function name change from `twoSum` to `twoSums`.
*   **2/14/2026, 3:49:28 PM:** Completion of the correct hash map implementation for `twoSums` after iterative fixes.
*   **2/14/2026, 5:16:20 PM:** Final correction of the `twoSums` return statement to correctly yield indices.
*   **2/14/2026, 5:58:31 PM:** The `twoSums` function is commented out, marking a complete switch from DSA problem-solving to basic Python dictionary exploration.
*   **2/14/2026, 6:00:32 PM:** Introduction of the `person` dictionary example.
*   **2/14/2026, 6:42:32 PM:** A `getPerson` function is correctly structured to return a dictionary, and its values are accessed properly using `.get("name")`.
*   **2/14/2026, 6:53:45 PM:** Demonstration of modifying a dictionary value (`person["age"] = 39`) and printing the result.
*   **2/14/2026, 8:45:51 PM:** Demonstration of removing a key-value pair from a dictionary using `person.pop("age")`.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**
*   **Consistent Docstring:** The docstring at the top of the file describing the "Two Sum" problem remained unchanged throughout all modifications, even when the code shifted its focus completely.
*   **Commented Test Cases:** Test calls for the `twoSum`/`twoSums` function (e.g., `print(twoSum([2,7,11,15], 9))`) frequently appeared as commented-out lines, suggesting a pattern of local testing.
*   **Iterative Refinement:** Code was often built and corrected in small, rapid steps, indicated by many closely spaced timestamps with minor modifications (e.g., completing an incomplete line, fixing syntax errors, or adjusting return values).
*   **Educational/Exploratory Nature:** The drastic shift from a DSA problem to basic dictionary operations, coupled with the incremental testing and correction, suggests that the file was used for learning or experimenting with fundamental Python concepts.

## 5:08:08 AM
The log details changes exclusively within the file `c:\projects\Musoko-DSA-Series\Python\1. Two Sum.py`.

Initially, between **2/14/2026, 3:42:33 PM** and **3:56:22 PM**, the file focused on implementing the "Two Sum" problem.
*   A Python function `twoSum` was defined, which used a hash map (named `map`) to find two numbers in an array that sum to a target, returning their indices.
*   This function was subsequently renamed to `twoSums`. The implementation of `twoSums` was built incrementally, mimicking the logic of the original `twoSum` function, involving:
    *   Initializing an empty dictionary (`map`).
    *   Iterating through the input `nums` array.
    *   Calculating the `complement` (target - current number).
    *   Checking if the `complement` exists in the `map`. If so, returning the indices.
    *   Storing the current number and its index in the `map`.
*   Testing lines using `print(twoSums([2,7,11,15], 9))` were added and uncommented. Brief attempts to return `[complement, i]` or `[complement, num]` instead of `[map[complement], i]` were made but reverted, maintaining the correct hash map lookup.

A significant shift occurred around **2/14/2026, 5:58:31 PM**. The entire `twoSums` function implementation and its test calls were commented out. The file's purpose then transitioned to experimenting with basic Python dictionary operations:
*   Several incomplete function definitions (`def prs`, `def person`, `def human`) appeared briefly, indicating initial exploration.
*   From **2/14/2026, 6:00:32 PM** onwards, a `person` dictionary was introduced (`{"name": "Jane", "age": 23, "is_female": True}`).
*   This was followed by demonstrations of accessing dictionary values using both direct key access (e.g., `person["name"]`) and the `.get()` method (e.g., `person.get("password")`), specifically highlighting how `.get()` can prevent `KeyError` for non-existent keys.
*   A new function `getPerson()` was developed, starting around **2/14/2026, 6:03:06 PM**. This function was refined to return a fixed dictionary (`{"name": "Collins", "age": 23, "email": "collins@gmail.com"}`).
*   Subsequent changes (until **2/14/2026, 8:49:09 PM**) continued to demonstrate dictionary manipulation through the `getPerson()` function:
    *   Accessing values returned by `getPerson()` using both `["key"]` (e.g., `getPerson()["name"]`) and `.get("key", default_value)` (e.g., `getPerson().get("password", "Does not exist")`).
    *   Modifying dictionary values (e.g., `person["age"] = 39`).
    *   Removing items using `.pop()` (e.g., `person.pop("age")`).

The recurring pattern is a shift from solving a specific Data Structures and Algorithms problem ("Two Sum") to exploring and demonstrating fundamental Python dictionary functionalities and methods, with the initial problem's code being entirely commented out in the later stages. Most changes involve small, iterative additions or modifications to test dictionary behavior.

## 6:08:12 AM
The log details changes to a single file: `c:\projects\Musoko-DSA-Series\Python\1. Two Sum.py`. The modifications occurred on **2/14/2026** across several hours.

**File-Specific Updates (`c:\projects\Musoko-DSA-Series\Python\1. Two Sum.py`):**

The file initially contained and iteratively developed a Python function named `twoSum` (later renamed `twoSums`).

*   **Early afternoon (3:42 PM - 5:16 PM):**
    *   The `twoSum` function was introduced and refined, aiming to solve the "Two Sum" problem using a hash map approach.
    *   Initial implementation at **3:42:33 PM** included the core logic for finding complements and storing numbers and their indices in a map.
    *   The function name was changed to `twoSums` around **3:45:48 PM**.
    *   The implementation details, including the loop, calculating the `complement`, checking its presence in the map, and returning indices, were built up progressively between **3:46 PM** and **3:49 PM**.
    *   Around **3:56 PM**, temporary bugs were introduced where `complement` or `num` (values) were incorrectly returned instead of their `map` indices.
    *   By **5:16:20 PM**, the `twoSums` function was corrected to return `[map[complement], i]`, indicating the correct indices.

*   **Later afternoon/Evening (5:58 PM - 8:46 PM):**
    *   A significant shift occurred around **5:58:31 PM** when the `twoSums` function and its associated print statements were almost entirely commented out.
    *   The focus then moved to demonstrating Python dictionary operations. Initial attempts to define functions like `prs`, `person`, `human` were made but quickly abandoned or commented out.
    *   A `person` dictionary was defined at **6:00:32 PM** (`{"name": "Jane", "age": 23, "is_female": True}`).
    *   Subsequent changes (from **6:00 PM to 6:02 PM**) explored accessing dictionary elements using both bracket notation (`person["name"]`) and the safer `person.get("key")` method.
    *   A new function `getPerson` was introduced around **6:03:06 PM** to encapsulate dictionary creation and retrieval. This function was iteratively refined.
    *   Between **6:33 PM** and **6:41 PM**, there were multiple attempts to properly define `getPerson` (initially with parameters, then without) and call it to retrieve specific dictionary values, often resulting in syntax errors or incorrect method calls.
    *   The correct pattern for calling `getPerson` and accessing its returned dictionary was established around **6:42:32 PM** with `print(getPerson().get("name"))`.
    *   Further experiments (from **6:46 PM to 6:50 PM**) demonstrated accessing values directly (`getPerson()["name"]`) and using `get()` with a default fallback value (`getPerson().get("password", "Does not exist")`).
    *   Dictionary modification was shown at **6:53:45 PM** by retrieving the dictionary, updating a value, and printing it (`person = getPerson(); person["age"] = 39; print(person)`).
    *   In the final series of changes (around **8:45 PM**), the `getPerson` function was modified to internally create, potentially modify (e.g., `person["age"] = 40`), or attempt to remove (e.g., `person.pop("age")` at **8:45:51 PM**) items from a dictionary before returning it. The last relevant change at **8:46:57 PM** showed `person.get("password","Not found")` inside `getPerson`, though `get()` itself does not modify the dictionary.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Iterative Refinement:** Both the `twoSums` function and the dictionary manipulation examples exhibit a strong pattern of iterative development, where code is incrementally added, tested (often with `print` statements), corrected, and refined across multiple commits within a short timeframe.
*   **Problem-Solving Focus:** The file serves as a scratchpad for solving specific programming problems or exploring language features. It shifted from a Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problem ("Two Sum") to fundamental Python dictionary operations.
*   **Commenting out unused code:** The initial `twoSums` solution was almost entirely commented out rather than deleted, suggesting it might be revisited or kept for reference.
*   **Consistent Docstring/Comment:** The problem description for "Two Sum" remained at the top of the file as a multi-line string comment throughout all changes, even when the code below it no longer directly addressed that problem. This indicates the primary purpose or context of the file.
*   **Testing with `print` statements:** Frequent use of `print()` statements to verify intermediate steps or final outputs of functions and dictionary operations.
