# Activity Summary for 2/11/2026

## 5:05:46 AM
The changes log shows a series of updates made on **2/10/2026** across three core files within a Django REST Framework (DRF) application, focusing on roles, user management, and permissions.

**File: `c:\projects\tat\tale-craft-media.api\tale_craft\apps\roles\api\views\role.py`**

This file, specifically the `RoleViewSet`, underwent several refinements related to permissions and error handling.
*   **Initial State (6:08:43 PM, 6:08:49 PM):** The `RoleViewSet` used `IsAdminUser` for permissions and raised a `ValueError` when attempting to delete a system role.
*   **Permission Refinement (6:09:10 PM, 6:09:29 PM):** The permission class was changed from `rest_framework.permissions.IsAdminUser` to a custom `apps.permissions.base.IsAdmin`, indicating a shift to a custom permission class for admin checks. The old import was subsequently removed.
*   **Error Handling Update (6:53:35 PM):** The error type raised when attempting to delete a system role was changed from `ValueError` to `ValidationError`.
*   **Import Correction (7:26:45 PM, 7:26:52 PM, 7:26:59 PM):** There were transient syntax errors with `from from` and incomplete `from django` imports, which were quickly resolved. The final change correctly imports `ValidationError` from `django.core.exceptions` to support the updated error handling.

**File: `c:\projects\tat\tale-craft-media.api\tale_craft\apps\users\api\views\user.py`**

The `UserViewSet` experienced significant changes to its permission structure and data visibility.
*   **Initial State (8:22:20 PM):** The `UserViewSet` included `permissions.IsAuthenticated` and `AdminCanManageUsers`. It dynamically selected serializers based on the action and provided a `me` endpoint for the current user.
*   **Permission Import Simplification (8:23:42 PM, 8:23:56 PM):** The import `permissions` from `rest_framework` was removed, and `permissions.IsAuthenticated` was replaced with direct `IsAuthenticated` (assuming it's imported elsewhere, or the `permissions` object was simply removed from the import statement).
*   **Added Object-Level Permissions (8:36:16 PM, 8:36:49 PM):** A new permission class, `IsOwnerOrAdmin`, was imported and added to the `permission_classes` list, indicating the introduction of object-level permission checks for user actions.
*   **Queryset Filtering (8:38:13 PM):** A `get_queryset` method was implemented. This crucial change restricts data access: administrators can view all users, but non-admin users can only retrieve their own user profile, significantly enhancing data security and access control.

**File: `c:\projects\tat\tale-craft-media.api\tale_craft\apps\permissions\user.py`**

This file defines custom permission classes used by other views.
*   **Initial State (8:32:28 PM):** It defined `AdminCanManageUsers` (allowing admins full user management and non-admins only the 'me' action) and `IsOwnerOrAdmin` (allowing access if the user is the object's owner or an admin).
*   **`IsOwnerOrAdmin` Logic Refinement (8:34:55 PM):** The `IsOwnerOrAdmin` permission's `has_object_permission` method was reordered. It now first checks if the user is an admin. If not, it checks if the object itself is the requesting user (`obj == request.user`). This makes the admin check more explicit and simplifies the owner check.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Focus on Permissions and Access Control:** A dominant theme across all changes is the refinement and strengthening of permission logic, especially for admin roles and object-level access (e.g., `IsAdmin`, `AdminCanManageUsers`, `IsOwnerOrAdmin`, and the `get_queryset` override in `UserViewSet`).
*   **Incremental Refinement:** Many changes occurred in quick succession, indicating a process of iterative development, testing, and immediate correction or enhancement (e.g., the rapid corrections in `role.py` imports, and the permission adjustments in `user.py` and `permissions.user.py`).
*   **DRF Best Practices:** The use of `ModelViewSet`, dynamic serializer selection (`get_serializer_class`), custom actions (`@action`), and custom permission classes aligns with common Django REST Framework development patterns for building robust APIs.
*   **Security Emphasis:** The changes consistently aim to improve the security and control over user and role data, preventing unauthorized deletions of system roles and restricting non-admin user data visibility.

## 6:05:50 AM
**File: `c:\projects\tat\tale-craft-media.api\tale_craft\apps\roles\api\views\role.py`**
Changes to the `RoleViewSet` primarily focused on refining permissions and error handling. Initially, the view used `IsAdminUser` for permissions. This was swiftly updated to a custom `IsAdmin` permission class (Timestamp: 2/10/2026, 6:09:10 PM, 6:09:29 PM). Later, the `perform_destroy` method, which prevents system roles from being deleted, was modified to raise a `ValidationError` instead of a `ValueError` (Timestamp: 2/10/2026, 6:53:35 PM). This change necessitated the import of `ValidationError` from `django.core.exceptions`, which involved a brief period of syntax errors before the correct import was established (Timestamps: 2/10/2026, 7:26:45 PM, 7:26:52 PM, 7:26:59 PM).

**File: `c:\projects\tat\tale-craft-media.api\tale_craft\apps\users\api\views\user.py`**
This file, defining the `UserViewSet`, underwent substantial changes to its permission and data visibility logic. Initially, `permission_classes` included `permissions.IsAuthenticated` and `AdminCanManageUsers`. The `IsAuthenticated` import was streamlined (Timestamps: 2/10/2026, 8:23:42 PM, 8:23:56 PM). A new permission, `IsOwnerOrAdmin`, was imported and subsequently added to the `permission_classes` list (Timestamps: 2/10/2026, 8:36:16 PM, 8:36:49 PM). The most significant change was the introduction of a `get_queryset` method (Timestamp: 2/10/2026, 8:38:13 PM). This method enforces role-based data access: administrators can view all users, while non-admin users are restricted to viewing only their own user profile.

**File: `c:\projects\tat\tale-craft-media.api\tale_craft\apps\permissions\user.py`**
The `AdminCanManageUsers` permission remained unchanged. The `IsOwnerOrAdmin` permission class, however, had its `has_object_permission` logic modified (Timestamp: 2/10/2026, 8:34:55 PM). Originally, it allowed access if `obj.user == request.user` or if the user was an admin. The updated logic simplifies this: if the user is an admin, permission is granted; otherwise, it checks if the `obj` itself is the `request.user`. This makes the permission more directly applicable to user objects where the object *is* the user.

**File: `c:\projects\tat\tale-craft-media.api\tale_craft\apps\permissions\post.py`**
This file, created on 2/11/2026, details post-related permissions and saw several additions and refinements.
*   `CanEditPost` defined specific rules for admins (edit anything), editors (edit drafts only), and writers (edit own drafts only).
*   `CanPublishPost` was refactored from using `has_permission` to `has_object_permission`, explicitly allowing only admins and editors to publish draft posts (Timestamp: 2/11/2026, 5:48:47 AM).
*   Similarly, `CanSchedulePost` was updated to use `has_object_permission`, permitting only admins and editors to schedule draft posts (Timestamp: 2/11/2026, 5:49:53 AM).
*   A new permission, `CanCreatePost`, was added, allowing authenticated users with "admin", "editor", or "writer" roles to create posts (Timestamp: 2/11/2026, 5:55:32 AM).
*   Another new permission, `CanDeletePost`, was introduced, restricting post deletion solely to administrators (Timestamp: 2/11/2026, 5:56:33 AM).

**Key Patterns and Recurring Elements:**
A consistent theme across these changes is the implementation and refinement of **role-based access control (RBAC)** using Django REST Framework's `BasePermission` classes. Access decisions frequently depend on `request.user.role.slug`, often checking for "admin," "editor," or "writer" roles. The codebase extensively utilizes `ModelViewSet` for API endpoints, with `get_serializer_class` and `get_queryset` methods being used to dynamically tailor behavior based on the current action and the requesting user's role. There's a clear emphasis on object-level permissions, with many new or updated permission classes transitioning to use `has_object_permission` where relevant. The timestamp data indicates that the bulk of these permission and view logic refinements occurred over two days: 2/10/2026 for roles and user management, and 2/11/2026 for post management.

## 8:05:50 AM
The code changes primarily focus on refining access control and permissions across different API endpoints, specifically for roles, users, and posts. All observed changes occurred between February 10-11, 2026.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\projects\tat\tale-craft-media.api\tale_craft\apps\roles\api\views\role.py`**
    *   **(2/10/2026, 6:08:43 PM - 6:09:29 PM):** The `RoleViewSet`'s permission class was transitioned from `rest_framework.permissions.IsAdminUser` to a custom `apps.permissions.base.IsAdmin`.
    *   **(2/10/2026, 6:53:35 PM):** The error raised when attempting to delete a system role within `perform_destroy` was changed from `ValueError` to `ValidationError`.
    *   **(2/10/2026, 7:26:45 PM - 7:26:59 PM):** An import statement for `ValidationError` was added, specifically `from django.core.exceptions import ValidationError`, to support the change in the `perform_destroy` method. There were temporary syntax errors introduced and fixed during this process.

*   **`c:\projects\tat\tale-craft-media.api\tale_craft\apps\users\api\views\user.py`**
    *   **(2/10/2026, 8:22:20 PM - 8:23:56 PM):** Unused imports for `permissions` were removed, and the `IsAuthenticated` permission was directly imported.
    *   **(2/10/2026, 8:36:16 PM - 8:36:49 PM):** The `IsOwnerOrAdmin` permission class was imported and subsequently added to the `UserViewSet`'s `permission_classes`.
    *   **(2/10/2026, 8:38:13 PM):** A `get_queryset` method was implemented in `UserViewSet`. This method restricts non-admin users to only view their own user profile, while admin users retain the ability to view all users.

*   **`c:\projects\tat\tale-craft-media.api\tale_craft\apps\permissions\user.py`**
    *   **(2/10/2026, 8:34:55 PM):** The `has_object_permission` method within the `IsOwnerOrAdmin` class was modified. It was updated to first check if the user is an "admin" and then, if not, to check if the requested object (`obj`) is the requesting user (`request.user`), refining the object-level permission logic.

*   **`c:\projects\tat\tale-craft-media.api\tale_craft\apps\permissions\post.py`**
    *   **(2/11/2026, 5:48:47 AM):** The `CanPublishPost` permission class was updated from a view-level `has_permission` to an object-level `has_object_permission`. It now requires the user to be an "admin" or "editor" AND the post's status (`obj.status`) to be `Post.Status.DRAFT`.
    *   **(2/11/2026, 5:49:53 AM):** Similarly, `CanSchedulePost` was updated from `has_permission` to `has_object_permission` with the same logic as `CanPublishPost`.
    *   **(2/11/2026, 5:55:32 AM):** A new permission class, `CanCreatePost`, was added. It allows authenticated users with "admin", "editor", or "writer" roles to create posts.
    *   **(2/11/2026, 5:56:33 AM):** Another new permission class, `CanDeletePost`, was added, granting permission only to users with the "admin" role.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** A consistent theme is the implementation and refinement of RBAC. Permissions are frequently tied to a user's `role.slug` (e.g., "admin", "editor", "writer").
*   **Granular Permissions:** There's a clear move towards more granular permissions, transitioning from broad view-level permissions (`has_permission`) to specific object-level permissions (`has_object_permission`), particularly evident in the `post.py` changes.
*   **Django REST Framework Integration:** All changes are within the context of Django REST Framework, using `ModelViewSet` and custom `BasePermission` classes.
*   **Error Handling Refinement:** The change from `ValueError` to `ValidationError` in role deletion indicates attention to more specific and user-friendly error messages.
*   **User Management Security:** Significant enhancements were made to user management, ensuring non-admins can only access their own data and introducing specific permissions for user creation and modification.

## 11:05:54 AM
**File: `c:\projects\tat\tale-craft-media.api\tale_craft\apps\roles\api\views\role.py`**
This file, defining the `RoleViewSet` for role management, underwent several permission and error handling adjustments between 6:08 PM and 7:26 PM on 2/10/2026.
*   Initially, it used `IsAdminUser` for permissions. This was quickly changed to a custom `IsAdmin` permission.
*   The `perform_destroy` method, which prevents deletion of system roles, was updated to raise `ValidationError` instead of `ValueError`. This change necessitated importing `ValidationError` from `django.core.exceptions`, which involved a couple of intermediate, malformed import attempts before the correct one was committed.

**File: `c:\projects\tat\tale-craft-media.api\tale_craft\apps\users\api\views\user.py`**
Updates to the `UserViewSet` occurred between 8:22 PM and 8:38 PM on 2/10/2026, focusing on access control and data visibility.
*   Initial imports of `permissions` were simplified.
*   A new permission, `IsOwnerOrAdmin`, was introduced and added to the `permission_classes` for the viewset, indicating a more granular control over user objects.
*   A `get_queryset` method was implemented to restrict data access: administrators can view all users, while non-admin users can only view their own profile.

**File: `c:\projects\tat\tale-craft-media.api\tale_craft\apps\permissions\user.py`**
The `User` permissions file was updated around 8:32 PM and 8:34 PM on 2/10/2026.
*   The `IsOwnerOrAdmin` permission's logic was refined. It now explicitly grants access to administrators first, and then checks if the requesting user is the object's owner.

**File: `c:\projects\tat\tale-craft-media.api\tale_craft\apps\permissions\post.py`**
Significant expansions and refinements of post-related permissions took place between 5:46 AM and 5:56 AM on 2/11/2026.
*   Initially, `CanPublishPost` and `CanSchedulePost` used `has_permission`. They were subsequently refactored to use `has_object_permission` and incorporate a check for the post's status (`Post.Status.DRAFT`), allowing publishing/scheduling only for draft posts.
*   A new permission, `CanCreatePost`, was added, allowing 'admin', 'editor', and 'writer' roles to create posts.
*   Another new permission, `CanDeletePost`, was added, restricted solely to 'admin' users.

**File: `c:\projects\tat\tale-craft-media.api\tale_craft\apps\posts\api\views\post.py`**
The `PostViewSet` was heavily modified around 9:39 AM on 2/11/2026, introducing features and fixing an anomaly.
*   The `permission_classes` were set to `IsAuthenticated` and `CanEditPost`.
*   The `get_queryset` method was enhanced to filter posts based on user roles (writers see only their own posts) and for unauthenticated users (only published posts).
*   Dedicated `publish` and `schedule` actions were added, with specific permission classes (`CanPublishPost`, `CanSchedulePost`). The `schedule` action now requires a `scheduled_publish_at` timestamp.
*   Caching mechanisms using `django.core.cache` were implemented for `retrieve` and `list` methods of published posts to improve performance.
*   Notably, a `publish` method appeared at the end of the file, which seems to be a misplaced model method, as it contains `self.save()` and cache invalidation logic.

**File: `c:\projects\tat\tale-craft-media.api\tale_craft\apps\posts\models\post.py`**
The `Post` model definition was adjusted between 9:57 AM and 10:01 AM on 2/11/2026, mostly concerning database indexes and publication logic.
*   The `Meta` class's `indexes` were clarified. A `models.Index(fields=["status", "published_at"])` was initially misplaced outside the `indexes` list, then removed, and finally correctly re-added within the `indexes` list.
*   The `publish` method was strengthened. It now raises a `ValueError` if an attempt is made to publish a post that is not in `DRAFT` or `IN_REVIEW` status, and it uses `update_fields` for more efficient saving.

**Key Patterns and Recurring Elements:**
*   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** There is a consistent and evolving pattern of implementing granular permissions based on user roles (`admin`, `editor`, `writer`) across the `roles`, `users`, and `posts` applications. Permissions are being refined from general `has_permission` to more specific `has_object_permission` checks.
*   **Error Handling Improvement:** A shift from generic `ValueError` to more specific `ValidationError` for business logic constraints, demonstrating a move towards more robust error feedback.
*   **Performance Optimization:** The introduction of `django.core.cache` for post retrieval and listing indicates a focus on optimizing application performance.
*   **Active Development:** All changes occurred within a tight timeframe (February 10-11, 2026), suggesting an active development sprint or focused feature implementation.
