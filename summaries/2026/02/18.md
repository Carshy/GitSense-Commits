# Activity Summary for 2/18/2026

## 4:31:29 AM
The `c:\projects\tat\tale-craft-media.api\tale_craft\apps\posts\models\post.py` file underwent a minor update between 2/18/2026, 4:19:52 AM and 2/18/2026, 4:20:10 AM.

The sole change in this file was to the `Post` model definition:
*   The `max_length` attribute for the `slug` field was increased from `255` to `300`. This change allows for longer, more descriptive slugs for posts.

The timestamps indicate a very rapid succession of changes, suggesting a quick adjustment to a field length.
