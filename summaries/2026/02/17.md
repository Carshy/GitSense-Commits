# Activity Summary for 2/17/2026

## 4:40:43 PM
The provided log details a series of code changes, primarily focusing on the setup and configuration of a Django REST Framework application, likely for media and content management. All changes occurred on **2/17/2026**, indicating a focused development session.

### File-Specific Updates:

*   **`c:\projects\tat\tale-craft-media.api\tale_craft\apps\media\api\serializers\post_media.py` (2:01:51 PM)**
    *   Introduced `PostMediaSerializer` to handle media file uploads and display.
    *   Configured fields like `id`, `file`, `file_large`, `file_medium`, `file_thumb`, `file_webp`, `status`, `alt_text`, `caption`, and `created_at`.
    *   Set several fields (`status`, `file_large`, `file_medium`, `file_thumb`, `file_webp`) as read-only.
    *   Implemented validation for uploaded files, restricting them to images only and a maximum size of 5MB.

*   **`c:\projects\tat\tale-craft-media.api\tale_craft\config\urls.py` (2:07:28 PM and 2:07:57 PM)**
    *   Initially (2:07:28 PM), significantly expanded the API routes by including URLs for `users`, `roles`, `authentication`, `posts`, `analytics`, and `categories` under `/api/v1/` and `/api/` prefixes.
    *   Integrated a sitemap (`sitemap.xml`) with `PostSitemap` and applied 1-hour caching to it.
    *   Shortly after (2:07:57 PM), the API route for `analytics` (`path("api/v1/analytics", include("apps.analytics.api.urls"))`) was commented out.

*   **`c:\projects\tat\tale-craft-media.api\tale_craft\apps\posts\api\urls.py` (2:14:57 PM)**
    *   Set up routing for the `posts` API, using `rest_framework.routers.DefaultRouter` to register `PostViewSet`.

*   **`c:\projects\tat\tale-craft-media.api\tale_craft\apps\posts\api\serializers\post.py` (2:17:44 PM)**
    *   Enhanced `PostSerializer` to include detailed post information, such as `author` and `published_by` (as read-only `StringRelatedField`s).
    *   Integrated `media_blocks` using the newly defined `PostMediaSerializer` (many-to-many, read-only).
    *   Expanded post fields to include SEO-related attributes (`seo_title`, `seo_description`, `seo_keywords`, `canonical_url`, `no_index`).
    *   Introduced `PostCreateSerializer` for creating posts, automatically assigning the requesting user as the `author`.

*   **`c:\projects\tat\tale-craft-media.api\tale_craft\apps\media\apps.py` (2:20:24 PM)**
    *   Defined the `AppConfig` for the `media` application.

*   **`c:\projects\tat\tale-craft-media.api\tale_craft\apps\categories\apps.py` (2:22:07 PM)**
    *   Defined the `AppConfig` for the `categories` application.

*   **`c:\projects\tat\tale-craft-media.api\tale_craft\config\settings\base.py` (multiple timestamps: 2:21:01 PM to 2:23:32 PM)**
    *   This file represents the project's base Django settings.
    *   Between 2:21:17 PM and 2:22:27 PM, `INSTALLED_APPS` was updated to include configurations for `apps.authentication`, `apps.media`, `apps.categories`, and `apps.analytics`.
    *   Minor revisions occurred at 2:22:44 PM and 2:22:50 PM with no apparent functional changes to the `INSTALLED_APPS` list.
    *   By 2:23:32 PM, the `apps.analytics.apps.AnalyticsConfig` was commented out from `INSTALLED_APPS`.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **New App Integration:** A recurring pattern is the introduction of new application configurations (`apps.py` files for `media` and `categories`) followed by their inclusion in the `INSTALLED_APPS` list within `config/settings/base.py`.
*   **API Endpoint Expansion:** There's a clear emphasis on expanding API capabilities, with new routes being added to `config/urls.py` for various application modules (users, roles, authentication, posts, categories, media, analytics).
*   **Analytics App/Route Deferral:** The `analytics` app and its corresponding API route were both introduced and then commented out or removed in short succession (2:07:28 PM -> 2:07:57 PM for URLs, and 2:22:27 PM -> 2:23:32 PM for settings), suggesting this feature might be paused or undergoing re-evaluation.
*   **Media and Post Feature Development:** Significant work was done on the `media` and `posts` applications, including detailed serializers, file validation, and integration of media blocks and SEO fields into posts.
*   **Centralized Configuration:** The `config/settings/base.py` and `config/urls.py` files serve as central points for integrating new app features and defining global settings and API endpoints.
