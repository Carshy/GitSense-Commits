# Activity Summary for 2/21/2026

## 11:57:03 AM
For the file `c:\projects\tat\tale-craft-media.api\tale_craft\apps\categories\api\views\category.py`, timestamped 2/21/2026, 10:00:54 AM, the `CategoryViewSet` was updated to implement more granular access control and data representation. Public actions (list and retrieve) now permit `AllowAny` access, while mutating actions (create, update, partial_update) require `IsAuthenticated` and `CanManageCategories` permissions. The viewset also dynamically selects serializers, using `CategoryAdminSerializer` for modification actions and `CategorySerializer` otherwise. A significant change to the `get_queryset` method involves annotating categories with a `post_count` (specifically for published posts) and filtering to return only `is_active=True` categories for public-facing list and retrieve operations.

The file `c:\projects\tat\tale-craft-media.api\tale_craft\apps\monetization\models\__init__.py` shows a series of rapid, incremental changes between 2/21/2026, 10:01:41 AM and 10:11:58 AM. These changes primarily involve refining the import statements for the `monetization` application's models. Initially, there were incomplete imports, which evolved to include `AdPlacement`, `AdUnit`, `Campaign`, `Impression`, and `Click`. Subsequent updates focused on individual imports from specific files, eventually settling on `AdCampaign`, `AdPlacement`, `AdUnit`, and `AdHourlyMetric`. This sequence indicates active development and structuring of the `monetization` app's model hierarchy.

On 2/21/2026, 10:09:09 AM, the file `c:\projects\tat\tale-craft-media.api\tale_craft\apps\monetization\apps.py` was created, defining the `MonetizationConfig` `AppConfig`. This is a standard Django component for registering the new monetization application within the project, setting `default_auto_field` to `BigAutoField` and naming the app `apps.monetization`.

A major new feature, the `AdCampaign` model, was introduced in `c:\projects\tat\tale-craft-media.api\tale_craft\apps\monetization\models\ad_campaign.py` at 2/21/2026, 10:11:12 AM. This model is designed for comprehensive management of advertising campaigns. It includes various `models.Choices` for `CampaignType`, `RevenueModel`, and `PriorityTier`. Key fields cover campaign identity (name, advertiser), scheduling (start/end dates), budgeting (total/daily budget), pricing (CPM, CPC, CPA rates), delivery goals (impressions/clicks goal and delivered counts), targeting (using `JSONField` for `target_countries` and `target_devices`), frequency capping, and delivery controls. The `Meta` class defines ordering by priority and start date, and includes specific `models.Index` fields, notably `GinIndex` for the `JSONField` targeting attributes to enable efficient queries. Utility methods are also provided for calculating campaign duration, checking live status, validating targeting criteria, and estimating spend.

The project's base settings file, `c:\projects\tat\tale-craft-media.api\tale_craft\config\settings\base.py`, saw several updates between 2/21/2026, 10:09:37 AM and 10:21:32 AM. The most significant changes include:
*   At 10:09:50 AM, `'apps.monetization.apps.MonetizationConfig'` was added to the `INSTALLED_APPS` list, formally integrating the new monetization application into the Django project.
*   At 10:21:32 AM, `'django.contrib.postgres'` was added to `INSTALLED_APPS`, likely to provide support for PostgreSQL-specific database features, such as the `GinIndex` utilized in the new `AdCampaign` model.
Other sections of the `base.py` file, including database configuration (reading from environment variables), REST Framework settings, JWT authentication, CORS, caching (Redis), and Celery configurations, remained consistent across these changes, reflecting a stable foundational setup.

**Key Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

The changes primarily revolve around the **introduction and integration of a new "monetization" application**. This is evidenced by the creation of its `apps.py`, the development of its core models (like `AdCampaign`), and the subsequent updates to the project's global settings to register this new app and its dependencies (e.g., `django.contrib.postgres` for advanced database features). There is a clear pattern of **iterative development** for the `__init__.py` file in `monetization/models`, indicating active refinement of the module's structure. Furthermore, the updates demonstrate a continued reliance on **Django REST Framework (DRF)** for API views, including sophisticated permission and serializer logic, and a preference for **PostgreSQL's advanced indexing capabilities** for efficient data querying.

## 12:57:01 PM
The file `c:\projects\tat\tale-craft-media.api\tale_craft\apps\categories\api\views\category.py` was updated on **2/21/2026, 10:00:54 AM**. This update defines the `CategoryViewSet`, which manages API access to category data. Key features include:
*   Permission control: `AllowAny` for listing and retrieving categories, but `IsAuthenticated` and `CanManageCategories` are required for create, update, or partial update operations.
*   Serializer logic: Uses `CategoryAdminSerializer` for modification actions and `CategorySerializer` for read actions.
*   Queryset optimization: Selects related parent categories and annotates each category with the count of its *published* posts. For public list/retrieve actions, it further filters to only show active categories.

The `c:\projects\tat\tale-craft-media.api\tale_craft\apps\monetization\models\__init__.py` file underwent a series of rapid changes between **2/21/2026, 10:01:41 AM** and **2/21/2026, 10:11:58 AM**. Initially, there were incomplete and partial import statements. These evolved to import various models explicitly from the `apps.monetization.models` sub-modules, including `AdCampaign`, `AdPlacement`, `AdUnit`, `AdMetrics` (later refined to `AdHourlyMetric`), `Click`, and `Impression`. The final state of this file by **10:11:58 AM** indicates that `AdCampaign`, `AdPlacement`, `AdUnit`, and `AdHourlyMetric` are the primary models being exposed through this `__init__.py`.

The `c:\projects\tat\tale-craft-media.api\tale_craft\apps\monetization\apps.py` file was created or updated on **2/21/2026, 10:09:09 AM** to define the `MonetizationConfig` class, which registers the `apps.monetization` application within the Django project, setting its `default_auto_field` to `BigAutoField`.

The `c:\projects\tat\tale-craft-media.api\tale_craft\apps\monetization\models\ad_campaign.py` file was introduced or significantly updated on **2/21/2026, 10:11:12 AM**. This file defines the `AdCampaign` model, a comprehensive Django model for managing advertising campaigns. It includes:

## 3:57:06 PM
The provided log details a series of code changes occurring on February 21, 2026, primarily focused on the development and integration of a new "monetization" application within the `tale-craft-media.api` project, alongside an update to the `categories` module.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\projects\tat\tale-craft-media.api\tale_craft\apps\categories\api\views\category.py` (Timestamp: 2/21/2026, 10:00:54 AM):**
    This file defines the `CategoryViewSet`, a Django REST Framework viewset for managing categories. Key aspects include:
    *   **Permission Management:** It implements granular permissions, allowing anonymous users to `list` and `retrieve` categories, while requiring `IsAuthenticated` and `CanManageCategories` permissions for `create`, `update`, and `partial_update` actions.
    *   **Serializer Selection:** Different serializers are used based on the action; `CategoryAdminSerializer` for modification actions and `CategorySerializer` for read-only actions.
    *   **Optimized Queryset:** The `get_queryset` method optimizes database queries by using `select_related("parent")` and annotates each category with a `post_count`, specifically counting only `PUBLISHED` posts. For public `list` and `retrieve` actions, it further filters categories to include only active ones (`is_active=True`).

*   **`c:\projects\tat\tale-craft-media.api\tale_craft\apps\monetization\models\__init__.py` (Multiple timestamps from 2/21/2026, 10:01:41 AM to 10:11:58 AM):**
    This `__init__.py` file underwent iterative development, indicating the active setup of the `monetization` application's model structure.
    *   Initial partial imports quickly evolved into a more structured approach.
    *   Around 10:03:40 AM, an initial set of models (`AdPlacement`, `AdUnit`, `Campaign`, `Impression`, `Click`) was imported collectively.
    *   Subsequent changes refined these imports, moving towards explicit imports from specific model files (e.g., `ad_campaign.py`, `ad_placement.py`).
    *   `AdMetrics` was introduced and then refined to `AdHourlyMetric` around 10:08:17 AM.
    *   The final state in this log (10:11:58 AM) indicates the explicit import of `AdCampaign`, `AdPlacement`, `AdUnit`, and `AdHourlyMetric`, suggesting `Click` and `Impression` might be handled differently or removed from this specific `__init__.py`'s exposure. This iterative refinement points to a clear effort to organize and expose the core models of the monetization module.

*   **`c:\projects\tat\tale-craft-media.api\tale_craft\apps\monetization\apps.py` (Timestamp: 2/21/2026, 10:09:09 AM):**
    A standard Django application configuration file was added, defining `MonetizationConfig` for the `apps.monetization` app. This is a crucial step for Django to recognize and load the new application.

*   **`c:\projects\tat\tale-craft-media.api\tale_craft\apps\monetization\models\ad_campaign.py` (Timestamp: 2/21/2026, 10:11:12 AM):**
    This file introduces the `AdCampaign` model, a comprehensive definition for advertising campaigns.
    *   **Detailed Fields:** It includes various fields for campaign management, such as `pricing_model` (CPM/CPC), `campaign_type` (Direct, Network, Affiliate, Native, House), `revenue_model` (CPM, CPC, CPA, Flat), and `priority_tier` (Guaranteed, High, Medium, Low, Remnant).
    *   **Budgeting and Scheduling:** Fields for `start_date`, `end_date`, `total_budget`, and `daily_budget` are defined, along with methods like `total_campaign_days` and `is_live`.
    *   **Delivery Goals and Metrics:** It tracks `impression_goal`, `click_goal`, `impressions_delivered`, and `clicks_delivered`. A `calculate_spend` method is included to estimate expenditure based on the revenue model.
    *   **Targeting and Controls:** Supports `target_countries` and `target_devices` (JSON fields), `max_impressions_per_user` for frequency capping, and `pacing_enabled` and `even_delivery` for delivery controls.
    *   **Indexes:** Multiple database indexes are defined for performance, including `campaign_type`, `is_active`, `priority_tier`, and GinIndexes for the JSON fields `target_countries` and `target_devices`.

*   **`c:\projects\tat\tale-craft-media.api\tale_craft\config\settings\base.py` (Multiple timestamps from 2/21/2026, 10:09:37 AM to 10:21:32 AM):**
    This file, which defines the base settings for the Django project, saw two primary functional changes:
    *   **Monetization App Integration:** At 10:09:50 AM, `'apps.monetization.apps.MonetizationConfig'` was added to the `INSTALLED_APPS` list, formally integrating the new monetization application into the project.
    *   **PostgreSQL Extensions:** At 10:21:32 AM, `'django.contrib.postgres'` was added to `INSTALLED_APPS`, enabling PostgreSQL-specific database features, likely to support functionalities like the GinIndex used in the `AdCampaign` model.
    The file otherwise reiterates existing configurations for Django REST Framework, JWT authentication, CORS settings, database connections (using environment variables), caching with Redis, and Celery for asynchronous tasks, along with a comprehensive logging setup.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Focused Development Session:** All changes occurred on February 21, 2026, within a roughly 20-minute window, indicating a concentrated development effort.
