# Activity Summary for 2/14/2026

## 4:08:07 PM
The provided log details changes exclusively to the file `c:\projects\Musoko-DSA-Series\Python\1. Two Sum.py`, all occurring on 2/14/2026, between 3:42:33 PM and 3:56:22 PM.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **Initial State (3:42:33 PM):** The file began with a `twoSum` function that correctly solved the "Two Sum" problem using a hash map. It iterated through the numbers, stored `num` and its `index` in a map, and checked if `target - num` (the `diff`) was already in the map to find the pair.
*   **Function Renaming and Gradual Re-implementation (3:45:48 PM - 3:49:28 PM):**
    *   The `twoSum` function was renamed to `twoSums`.
    *   The implementation of `twoSums` was built incrementally over several steps. This included initializing the `map`, setting up the `for` loop, calculating `complement`, checking `if complement in map`, and building the `return [map[complement], i]` statement. Many intermediate commits show partially typed or syntactically incorrect lines (e.g., `comple`, `if com`, `return map[]`, `return num = i`, `return map[num] == i`) before the complete and correct logic `map[num] = i` was finally established.
*   **Testing Code Adjustments (3:54:40 PM - 3:54:50 PM):**
    *   Commented test print statements were uncommented. Initially, there was an incorrect call to the old `twoSum` function, which was quickly corrected to `print(twoSums([2,7,11,15], 9))`.
*   **Introduction of Logic Errors (3:56:08 PM - 3:56:22 PM):**
    *   A significant regression in the `twoSums` function occurred. The return statement `return [map[complement], i]` (which correctly returns the indices) was first changed to `return [complement, i]` (returning a value and an index), and then to `return [complement, num]` (returning two values). Both of these latter changes are incorrect for the "Two Sum" problem, which specifically requires returning the *indices* of the two numbers.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **2/14/2026, 3:42:33 PM:** Initial complete implementation of `twoSum`.
*   **2/14/2026, 3:45:48 PM:** Renaming function to `twoSums` and beginning of its re-implementation.
*   **2/14/2026, 3:49:28 PM:** Completion of the correct `twoSums` function logic after several iterative, partial updates.
*   **2/14/2026, 3:56:08 PM & 3:56:22 PM:** Introduction of critical logic errors in the `return` statement.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements:**

*   **Iterative Development:** There's a clear pattern of small, incremental changes, especially during the re-implementation of the `twoSums` function. Lines of code were added or refined character by character, indicating an active coding or debugging session.
*   **Docstring Consistency:** The docstring at the beginning of the file remains unchanged across all entries, providing a consistent problem description.
*   **Hash Map Usage:** The core pattern for solving the "Two Sum" problem (using a hash map to store numbers and their indices for efficient lookup) is consistently maintained throughout the correct implementations.
*   **Debugging/Testing Comments:** Commented `print` statements for testing are present throughout, indicating a practice of local testing.
