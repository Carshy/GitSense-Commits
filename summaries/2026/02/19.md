# Activity Summary for 2/19/2026

## 1:31:52 AM
The provided log details significant development activity within the `tale-craft-media.api` project, primarily focusing on media handling and post management. The changes span models, tasks, serializers, and views, indicating a refactoring and enhancement of how media assets are integrated and managed with posts.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\projects\tat\tale-craft-media.api\tale_craft\apps\posts\models\post.py`**
    *   **Timestamps:** 2/18/2026, 4:19:52 AM, 4:20:10 AM, 4:40:20 AM, 11:53:54 AM, 11:54:04 AM, 11:54:20 AM, 11:54:35 AM, 11:54:42 AM.
    *   Initially, the `Post` model included `featured_image` and `thumbnail` as direct `ImageField`s.
    *   A significant change occurred around **4:40:20 AM** where `featured_image` and `thumbnail` were removed and replaced with `ForeignKey` relationships to a new `media.MediaAsset` model: `featured_media`, `thumbnail_media`, and `og_media`. This indicates a shift towards a more centralized and structured media management system, where media assets are separate entities with their own lifecycle and variants.
    *   The `slug` field's `max_length` was increased from 255 to 300 around **4:20:10 AM**.
    *   The `content` field's `help_text` was updated to reflect "Block-based structured content referencing MediaAsset IDs" (later changed to "Media IDs") to align with the new media integration.
    *   Minor adjustments to comments, moving from `WORKFLOW STATUS` to `WORKFLOW`.
    *   The `invalidate_cache` method was updated to clear a category-specific cache (`posts:category:{self.category_id}`).
    *   Subsequent changes (around 11:54 AM) further refined the ForeignKey references, specifically updating `featured_media`, `thumbnail_media`, and `og_media` to reference `media.Media` instead of `media.MediaAsset` (though `MediaAsset` name reappears briefly, then stabilizes to `Media`). This suggests a renaming of the MediaAsset model to Media.

*   **`c:\projects\tat\tale-craft-media.api\tale_craft\apps\media\models\post_media.py`**
    *   **Timestamps:** 2/18/2026, 4:52:16 AM, 4:52:35 AM.
    *   This file was introduced to define the `MediaAsset` model, which encapsulates media properties like `media_type`, `processing_status`, `original_file`, `optimized_variants` (stored as JSON), `dimensions`, `file_size`, `file_hash`, `alt_text`, `caption`, and `uploaded_by`.
    *   Around **4:52:35 AM**, the class name `MediaAsset` was renamed to `Media`. This is a crucial change that impacts imports and references across the codebase.

*   **`c:\projects\tat\tale-craft-media.api\tale_craft\apps\media\tasks.py`**
    *   **Timestamp:** 2/18/2026, 5:01:44 AM.
    *   A new Celery task `process_media` was added. This task handles asynchronous media processing:
        *   It opens the original image using PIL.
        *   Extracts metadata like width, height, file size, and computes SHA256 hash for deduplication.
        *   Generates optimized WEBP variants (large, medium, thumb, and an original webp) and stores their paths in the `variants` JSON field.
        *   Updates the `MediaAsset` (or `Media`) object's status to `READY` upon successful processing, or `FAILED` on error, with retry logic.
        *   It uses a configurable `IMAGE_VARIANTS` dictionary for defining target sizes.

*   **`c:\projects\tat\tale-craft-media.api\tale_craft\apps\media\api\serializers\post_media.py`**
    *   **Timestamps:** 2/18/2026, 5:07:18 AM to 5:08:29 AM, and 5:43:01 AM to 5:43:56 AM.
    *   This file defines `MediaAssetSerializer` (later `MediaSerializer`). It provides `url` and `srcset` fields as `SerializerMethodField`s to dynamically generate URLs for the best available media variant and responsive image sets, respectively.
    *   Repeated renames from `MediaAssetSerializer` to `MediaSerializer` and `MediaAsset` model to `Media` model, including import paths (`apps.media.models` to `apps.media.api.models` and back to `apps.media.models.post_media`). This indicates a period of naming refactoring and stabilization.

*   **`c:\projects\tat\tale-craft-media.api\tale_craft\apps\media\api\views\post_media.py`**
    *   **Timestamps:** 2/18/2026, 5:14:29 AM to 5:16:54 AM.
    *   Introduces `MediaViewSet` (briefly `MediaView` at 5:16:23 AM).
    *   The `MediaViewSet` handles CRUD operations for media.
    *   `perform_create` is updated to set the media status to `UPLOADED` and then triggers the `process_media` Celery task for asynchronous processing.
    *   `get_queryset` is implemented to ensure users can only view their own uploaded media, suggesting user-specific media libraries.
    *   A `destroy` method prevents deletion of media assets that are actively used in posts, returning a `400_BAD_REQUEST` if in use.
    *   Repeated renames of `MediaAsset` to `Media` in imports and class references, mirroring changes in the models and serializers.

*   **`c:\projects\tat\tale-craft-media.api\tale_craft\apps\posts\api\serializers\postlist.py`**
    *   **Timestamps:** 2/18/2026, 5:27:26 AM to 5:27:48 AM, and 11:44:11 AM.
    *   Updated to use `MediaAssetSerializer` (later `MediaSerializer`) for the `thumbnail` field, sourcing from `thumbnail_media`. This reflects the new FK relationship for media.

*   **`c:\projects\tat\tale-craft-media.api\tale_craft\apps\posts\api\serializers\postdetail.py`**
    *   **Timestamps:** 2/18/2026, 5:28:46 AM, 5:29:15 AM.
    *   Updated to use `MediaAssetSerializer` (later `MediaSerializer`) for `featured_media`, `thumbnail_media`, and `og_media` fields, aligning with the model changes.

*   **`c:\projects\tat\tale-craft-media.api\tale_craft\apps\posts\api\serializers\postcreate.py`**
    *   **Timestamps:** 2/18/2026, 5:30:14 AM to 5:31:05 AM.
    *   The import for the media model was updated from `apps.media.models.MediaAsset` to `apps.media.models.Media`.
    *   The `validate_content` method was introduced (or updated) to specifically validate `media_id`s within "image" blocks of the JSON `content`. It checks if referenced media assets exist and have a `READY` status, enforcing data integrity and preventing posts from referencing unprocessed or invalid media.

*   **`c:\projects\tat\tale-craft-media.api\tale_craft\apps\posts\api\serializers\postupdate.py`**
    *   **Timestamp:** 2/18/2026, 5:31:47 AM.
    *   Introduces `PostUpdateSerializer` with validation logic for updating posts.
    *   Enforces role-based permissions: writers can only edit draft posts and cannot change the status, while editors/admins can publish (setting `published_at` and `published_by`) or schedule posts (requiring `scheduled_publish_at`).

*   **`c:\projects\tat\tale-craft-media.api\tale_craft\apps\posts\api\views\post.py`**
    *   **Timestamps:** 2/18/2026, 5:39:49 AM to 5:54:13 AM.
    *   Refactored the `PostViewSet` to be more robust, including:
        *   **Optimized Queryset:** Uses `select_related` for `author` and `category`, and `prefetch_related` for `media_blocks` (though `media_blocks` field is not present in the model's final state from this log, it suggests an intention or previous setup).
        *   **Action-Based Permissions:** Implements granular permissions (`CanCreatePost`, `CanEditPost`, `CanPublishPost`, `CanSchedulePost`) for different actions (list, retrieve, create, update, publish, schedule).
        *   **Serializer Switching:** Dynamically selects `PostCreateSerializer`, `PostListSerializer`, or `PostSerializer` based on the action.
        *   **Role-Aware Queryset Control:** Filters posts based on user authentication status and role (public users see only published posts, writers see only their own posts, editors/admins see all). Also allows filtering by category.
        *   **Caching:** Implements caching for `list` views (public access only, 5-minute cache) and `retrieve` views (published posts only, 10-minute cache) to improve performance.
        *   **Cache Invalidation:** `perform_update` and `perform_destroy` methods explicitly delete cached entries for the updated/deleted post.
        *   **Custom Actions:** Adds `@action` decorators for `publish` and `schedule` functionalities, including validation and cache invalidation.
        *   Repeated fixes in imports, specifically for serializers like `PostSerializer`, `PostCreateSerializer`, `PostListSerializer`, and the introduction of `PostUpdateSerializer`. This indicates a comprehensive review and reorganization of the API layer for posts.

*   **`c:\projects\tat\tale-craft-media.api\tale_craft\apps\posts\models\__init__.py`**
    *   **Timestamps:** 2/18/2026, 11:38:05 AM, 11:38:38 AM.
    *   Imports `Post` model. Minor reformat.

*   **`c:\projects\tat\tale-craft-media.api\tale_craft\apps\media\models\__init__.py`**
    *   **Timestamps:** 2/18/2026, 11:40:48 AM, 11:41:01 AM, 11:41:19 AM, 11:42:22 AM.
    *   Initially tried importing `Post` and `Category` from `apps.posts`, then corrected to import `Media` from its correct path. This shows a fix for incorrect `__init__.py` imports.

*   **`c:\projects\tat\tale-craft-media.api\tale_craft\apps\categories\models\__init__.py`**
    *   **Timestamps:** 2/18/2026, 11:51:17 AM, 11:51:28 AM, 11:51:34 AM.
    *   Corrected the `__init__.py` to properly import `Category` from `apps.categories.models.category`.

*   **`c:\projects\tat\tale-craft-media.api\tale_craft\apps\categories\models\category.py`**
    *   **Timestamp:** 2/18/2026, 2:38:49 PM.
    *   This file defines the `Category` model with fields like `name`, `slug`, `description`, SEO fields, control fields (`is_active`, `is_featured`, `order`), and a self-referencing `parent` for hierarchy.
    *   Includes `Meta` options for ordering and indexes.
    *   Implements a `save` method to automatically generate a unique slug if not provided, handling conflicts.

*   **`c:\projects\tat\tale-craft-media.api\tale_craft\apps\categories\api\serializers\category.py`**
    *   **Timestamps:** 2/18/2026, 3:17:53 PM, 3:19:47 PM.
    *   Introduces `CategorySerializer` for public display, including `post_count` (read-only) and `parent` (slug-related).
    *   Introduces `CategoryAdminSerializer` which exposes all fields for administrative purposes.

*   **`c:\projects\tat\tale-craft-media.api\tale_craft\apps\categories\api\views\category.py`**
    *   **Timestamp:** 2/18/2026, 3:26:50 PM.
    *   Introduces `CategoryViewSet` for managing categories.
    *   **Permission Control:** Uses `AllowAny` for listing/retrieving and `IsAuthenticated, CanManageCategories` for other actions.
    *   **Serializer Switching:** Uses `CategoryAdminSerializer` for create/update/partial_update and `CategorySerializer` otherwise.
    *   **Optimized Queryset:** Annotates `post_count` by filtering only published posts related to the category. Public users only see active categories.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **2/18/2026, 4:40:20 AM:** Major refactoring in `Post` model, shifting from direct image fields to Foreign Keys referencing a separate media asset model. This is a critical architectural change.
*   **2/18/2026, 4:52:16 AM - 4:52:35 AM:** Introduction of `post_media.py` defining `MediaAsset` (quickly renamed to `Media`) model, establishing the new media management system.
*   **2/18/2026, 5:01:44 AM:** Addition of `tasks.py` for asynchronous media processing (generating variants, metadata extraction, hashing).
*   **2/18/2026, 5:07:18 AM - 5:08:29 AM, 5:43:01 AM - 5:43:56 AM:** Introduction and subsequent renamings/refinements of `MediaAssetSerializer`/`MediaSerializer`, indicating rapid iteration on the media API.
*   **2/18/2026, 5:14:29 AM - 5:16:54 AM:** Development of `MediaViewSet` for media API endpoints, including upload processing and deletion restrictions.
*   **2/18/2026, 5:30:14 AM - 5:31:05 AM:** `PostCreateSerializer` gains media validation logic, ensuring integrity of referenced media IDs.
*   **2/18/2026, 5:31:47 AM:** `PostUpdateSerializer` introduced, implementing role-based update logic for posts.
*   **2/18/2026, 5:39:49 AM - 5:54:13 AM:** Significant evolution of `PostViewSet`, incorporating granular permissions, serializer switching, role-aware querysets, and extensive caching mechanisms with invalidation. This represents a mature API design for posts.
*   **2/18/2026, 11:42:22 AM:** `apps/media/models/__init__.py` is fixed to import `Media` correctly.
*   **2/18/2026, 11:51:34 AM:** `apps/categories/models/__init__.py` is fixed to import `Category` correctly.
*   **2/18/2026, 2:38:49 PM:** Introduction of the `Category` model, providing structured organization for posts.
*   **2/18/2026, 3:17:53 PM - 3:19:47 PM:** Development of `CategorySerializer` and `CategoryAdminSerializer`.
*   **2/18/2026, 3:26:50 PM:** `CategoryViewSet` is established, implementing category management, post counting, and permission handling.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Refactoring Media Handling:** The most dominant pattern is the significant refactoring of media integration. It moved from simple `ImageField`s directly on the `Post` model to a dedicated `MediaAsset`/`Media` model with `ForeignKey` relationships. This implies a more robust and scalable solution for handling different media types, processing, and generating optimized variants.
*   **Asynchronous Processing:** The introduction of Celery tasks (`process_media`) for media processing highlights a shift towards asynchronous operations for computationally intensive tasks, preventing blocking of API requests.
*   **Model/Serializer/View Consistency:** There's a clear pattern of updating models, then their corresponding serializers, and finally the views to reflect changes. The numerous renamings (e.g., `MediaAsset` to `Media`, `PostMediaSerializer` to `MediaSerializer`) across multiple files (models, serializers, views) demonstrate a rapid iterative development or stabilization phase for naming conventions.
*   **Role-Based Permissions and Logic:** Permissions are a recurring theme, with `IsAuthenticated` and custom permission classes (e.g., `CanCreatePost`, `CanManageCategories`) extensively used across viewsets (`PostViewSet`, `CategoryViewSet`, `MediaViewSet`). The `PostUpdateSerializer` specifically implements role-based validation for updating post status.
*   **Caching for Performance:** `PostViewSet` prominently features caching mechanisms for `list` and `retrieve` actions, with explicit cache invalidation on `update` and `destroy`. This indicates a focus on optimizing API performance for both public and authenticated users.
*   **Structured Content and SEO:** Both `Post` and `Category` models include comprehensive SEO fields (`seo_title`, `seo_description`, `seo_keywords`, `canonical_url`, `no_index`), and the `Post` model supports "Block-based structured content" referencing media IDs, suggesting a rich content management system.
*   **Database Indexing:** `Meta` classes in models consistently define database indexes for frequently queried fields (e.g., `status`, `slug`, `category`, `published_at`, `file_hash`, `media_type`), indicating attention to database performance.
*   **Clear Code Structure:** The use of descriptive comments (e.g., `WORKFLOW STATUS`, `CORE CONTENT`, `RELATIONSHIPS`, `BUSINESS LOGIC`) within model definitions and viewsets helps organize the code and clarify its purpose.
*   **Import Refinements:** Multiple `__init__.py` files were adjusted to ensure correct module imports, often fixing initial omissions or incomplete imports.

## 10:32:16 AM
The provided log details a concentrated series of changes on February 18, 2026, primarily focused on enhancing media management and integrating it with post functionality, alongside general API and model improvements.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\projects\tat\tale-craft-media.api\tale_craft\apps\posts\models\post.py`**
    *   **(04:19:52 AM - 04:20:10 AM)**: The initial `Post` model was defined with workflow statuses, core content fields (including a `JSONField` for block-based content), relationships to authors and categories, comprehensive SEO fields, analytics, and timestamps. A minor update quickly followed, extending the `slug` field's maximum length from 255 to 300 characters.
    *   **(04:40:20 AM - 11:54:42 AM)**: A significant refactoring occurred to centralize media management. Direct `ImageField`s for `featured_image`, `thumbnail`, and `og_image` were removed. Instead, `ForeignKey` relationships (`featured_media`, `thumbnail_media`, `og_media`) were introduced, pointing to a new `media.MediaAsset` model (later consistently renamed to `media.Media`). The content `JSONField`'s help text was updated to reference "Media IDs." The `schedule` method was adjusted to set the status directly to `SCHEDULED`, and cache invalidation was refined to target specific category caches. Throughout this period, there were multiple small adjustments to ensure consistency in referencing the `Media` model, correcting `ForeignKey` references and comments.

*   **`c:\projects\tat\tale-craft-media.api\tale_craft\apps\media\models\post_media.py`**
    *   **(04:52:16 AM)**: Introduced the `MediaAsset` model, defining media types (Image, Video) and processing statuses (Uploaded, Processing, Ready, Failed). It includes fields for the original file, a `JSONField` for optimized variants, metadata (dimensions, file size, hash), SEO text, and ownership.
    *   **(04:52:35 AM)**: The `MediaAsset` model was immediately renamed to `Media` for brevity and consistency.

*   **`c:\projects\tat\tale-craft-media.api\tale_craft\apps\media\tasks.py`**
    *   **(05:01:44 AM)**: A Celery shared task `process_media` was introduced for asynchronous media processing. This task handles opening images, converting them to RGB, extracting metadata (width, height, file size, SHA256 hash), generating multiple optimized WEBP variants (large, medium, thumb), and saving them. It updates the `MediaAsset` (later `Media`) model's `status` and `variants` field in an atomic transaction, with error handling and retry logic.

*   **`c:\projects\tat\tale-craft-media.api\tale_craft\apps\media\api\serializers\post_media.py`**
    *   **(05:07:18 AM - 05:08:29 AM)**: The `MediaAssetSerializer` was created, featuring `url` and `srcset` fields to provide responsive image URLs based on processed variants. This serializer underwent several rapid changes: being renamed to `MediaSerializer`, correcting its `Meta.model` reference from `MediaAsset` to `Media`, and updating internal status checks (`obj.status != MediaAsset.Status.READY` to `Media.Status.READY`).
    *   **(05:43:01 AM - 05:43:56 AM)**: Further adjustments were made to the import path for the `Media` model within the serializer.

*   **`c:\projects\tat\tale-craft-media.api\tale_craft\apps\media\api\views\post_media.py`**
    *   **(05:14:29 AM - 05:16:54 AM)**: The `MediaViewSet` was introduced to manage media uploads. It integrates with the `process_media` Celery task. Key changes included refining `perform_create` to trigger async processing and adding a `destroy` method to prevent deletion of media used in posts. There were also several rapid fixes: correcting serializer imports, changing references from `MediaAsset` to `Media` in the queryset and `perform_create`, and briefly renaming the class to `MediaView` before reverting to `MediaViewSet`.

*   **`c:\projects\tat\tale-craft-media.api\tale_craft\apps\posts\api\serializers\postlist.py`**
    *   **(05:27:26 AM - 11:44:11 AM)**: The `PostListSerializer` was created, including `StringRelatedField` for author and category, and a `MediaSerializer` (initially `MediaAssetSerializer`) for `thumbnail_media`. Adjustments primarily involved updating the serializer reference from `MediaAssetSerializer` to `MediaSerializer` and correcting import paths.

*   **`c:\projects\tat\tale-craft-media.api\tale_craft\apps\posts\api\serializers\postdetail.py`**
    *   **(05:28:46 AM - 05:29:15 AM)**: The `PostDetailSerializer` was established, featuring detailed fields for posts including SEO and media, with `featured_media`, `thumbnail_media`, and `og_media` using the `MediaSerializer` (initially `MediaAssetSerializer`).

*   **`c:\projects\tat\tale-craft-media.api\tale_craft\apps\posts\api\serializers\postcreate.py`**
    *   **(05:30:14 AM - 05:31:05 AM)**: The `PostCreateSerializer` was added, with a robust `validate_content` method to ensure structured content blocks are valid and reference existing, "READY" media items. It also sets the author and initial status to `DRAFT`. This serializer also saw corrections to consistently refer to `Media` and `Media.Status.READY`.

*   **`c:\projects\tat\tale-craft-media.api\tale_craft\apps\posts\api\serializers\postupdate.py`**
    *   **(05:31:47 AM)**: The `PostUpdateSerializer` was introduced, implementing role-based update logic. Writers are restricted from changing status or editing non-draft posts, while editors/admins can publish or schedule posts, requiring `scheduled_publish_at` for scheduled posts.

*   **`c:\projects\tat\tale-craft-media.api\tale_craft\apps\posts\api\views\post.py`**
    *   **(05:39:49 AM - 05:54:13 AM)**: The `PostViewSet` was developed as a comprehensive API endpoint for posts. It features action-based permissions (public access for list/retrieve, authenticated with specific permissions for others), serializer switching based on action, and role-aware queryset filtering. Crucially, it implements extensive caching for public list and retrieve operations, with cache invalidation on updates and deletions. Custom `publish` and `schedule` actions are also provided, each invalidating relevant caches. This file underwent numerous minor adjustments to its import statements for serializers, indicating an ongoing development and cleanup process.

*   **`c:\projects\tat\tale-craft-media.api\tale_craft\apps\posts\api\serializers\post.py`**
    *   **(05:45:58 AM - 05:49:13 AM)**: This file defined a generic `PostSerializer` and a `PostCreateSerializer` (which was also defined in `postcreate.py`, suggesting potential redundancy or different contexts). The `PostSerializer` included related fields for author, publisher, and `media_blocks` (using `MediaSerializer`). Corrections were made to import paths and the specific serializer used for `media_blocks` from `PostMediaSerializer` to `MediaSerializer`.

*   **`c:\projects\tat\tale-craft-media.api\tale_craft\apps\posts\models\__init__.py`**
    *   **(11:38:05 AM - 11:38:38 AM)**: Simple `__init__.py` to import `Post` model.

*   **`c:\projects\tat\tale-craft-media.api\tale_craft\apps\media\models\__init__.py`**
    *   **(11:40:48 AM - 11:42:22 AM)**: This `__init__.py` file was initially incorrectly importing `Post` and `Category` before being corrected to import `Media` from `post_media`.

*   **`c:\projects\tat\tale-craft-media.api\tale_craft\apps\categories\models\__init__.py`**
    *   **(11:51:17 AM - 11:51:34 AM)**: This `__init__.py` file was created, with initial incomplete imports rapidly corrected to `from apps.categories.models.category import Category`.

*   **`c:\projects\tat\tale-craft-media.api\tale_craft\apps\categories\models\category.py`**
    *   **(02:38:49 PM)**: Introduced the `Category` model, defining name, slug (with auto-slug generation), description, SEO fields, and control fields (`is_active`, `is_featured`, `order`, `parent` for hierarchy). Includes `Meta` options for ordering and indexing.

*   **`c:\projects\tat\tale-craft-media.api\tale_craft\apps\categories\api\serializers\category.py`**
    *   **(03:17:53 PM - 03:19:47 PM)**: Two serializers were introduced: `CategorySerializer` for public display (including `post_count` and `parent` as slug) and `CategoryAdminSerializer` for management, which was initially `__all__` and later made explicit with all fields.

*   **`c:\projects\tat\tale-craft-media.api\tale_craft\apps\categories\api\views\category.py`**
    *   **(03:26:50 PM)**: The `CategoryViewSet` was created, implementing action-based permissions (public access for list/retrieve, authenticated with `CanManageCategories` for others) and serializer switching. Its `get_queryset` method annotates the count of published posts for each category and filters for active categories in public views.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **2/18/2026, 4:40:20 AM**: Major architectural shift in `Post` model from direct image fields to `ForeignKey` relationships with a dedicated media model.
*   **2/18/2026, 4:52:16 AM**: Introduction of the `MediaAsset` model, forming the core of the new media management system.
*   **2/18/2026, 4:52:35 AM**: Immediate rename of `MediaAsset` model to `Media`, indicating a naming convention decision.
*   **2/18/2026, 5:01:44 AM**: Introduction of Celery `process_media` task for asynchronous image processing, critical for performance.
*   **2/18/2026, 5:07:41 AM - 5:08:29 AM**: Rapid renaming and correction of `MediaAssetSerializer` to `MediaSerializer` and its internal `Status` references.
*   **2/18/2026, 5:14:39 AM**: Major refactor of `MediaViewSet`, including `get_queryset`, `perform_create`, and a `destroy` method to prevent deleting in-use media.
*   **2/18/2026, 5:39:49 AM**: Initial comprehensive `PostViewSet` implementation with advanced features like action-based permissions, serializer switching, role-aware querysets, and extensive caching.
*   **2/18/2026, 5:31:47 AM**: Introduction of `PostUpdateSerializer` with crucial role-based access control for post modifications.
*   **2/18/2026, 11:42:22 AM**: Correction of `apps.media.models.__init__.py` to correctly import `Media`.
*   **2/18/2026, 11:54:42 AM**: Final consistency fix in `Post` model, ensuring all media FKs point to `media.Media`.
*   **2/18/2026, 2:38:49 PM**: Introduction of the `Category` model, setting up the category management system.
*   **2/18/2026, 3:26:50 PM**: Introduction of `CategoryViewSet` with its own permissions, serializer switching, and queryset enhancements.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Media System Overhaul**: The most significant pattern is the complete shift from direct image file handling to a robust, asynchronous media asset management system. This involved creating new models (`Media`), Celery tasks (`process_media`), and serializers (`MediaSerializer`), and then integrating these into the existing `Post` model and its associated API components.
*   **Naming Consistency Issues and Corrections**: There's a recurring theme of initially using `MediaAsset` and then consistently renaming it to `Media` across multiple files (models, serializers, views, and their import paths). This indicates a deliberate refactoring effort to standardize naming.
*   **Asynchronous Processing**: The introduction of Celery tasks for media variant generation highlights a focus on non-blocking operations and improved user experience.
*   **API Design Principles**: Adherence to RESTful API design with `ModelViewSet`s, action-based permissions, serializer switching, and role-based access control is evident across both `Post` and `Category` APIs.
*   **Performance Optimization**: Extensive use of caching (list views, individual objects) in the `PostViewSet` with explicit invalidation strategies points to a strong emphasis on performance for high-traffic endpoints. `select_related` and `prefetch_related` are also consistently used in querysets.
*   **Structured Content and SEO**: Both `Post` and `Category` models include dedicated fields for SEO, and `Post` content is structured as a `JSONField` referencing media IDs, suggesting a flexible content editing experience.
*   **Rapid Iteration**: The closely spaced timestamps, especially in the early hours (4 AM - 6 AM), indicate a period of intense and iterative development, with immediate corrections and refinements being applied to newly introduced code.
