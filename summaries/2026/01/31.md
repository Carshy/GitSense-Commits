It defines the core logic for creating both regular users (`create_user`) and superusers (`create_superuser`). Key aspects include email normalization, password hashing, and validation for superuser privileges (`is_staff`, `is_superuser`).

*   **`c:\projects\tat\tale-craft-media.api\tale_craft\apps\users\models\user.py` (Timestamp: 1/30/2026, 5:18:53 PM):** This file defines the custom `User` model for the application, inheriting from `AbstractBaseUser` and `PermissionsMixin`. It establishes `email` as the unique identifier and `USERNAME_FIELD`, with `username` as a `REQUIRED_FIELD`. Other fields include `is_active`, `is_staff`, `date_joined`, and `updated_at`. The model utilizes the `UserManager` defined previously and sets up database indexing for `email` and `username` for performance.

*   **`c:\projects\tat\tale-craft-media.api\tale_craft\apps\users\models\profile.py` (Timestamp: 1/30/2026, 10:03:23 PM):** This file introduces a comprehensive `Profile` model designed to store extensive personal information for each user. It features a `OneToOneField` link to the `User` model and includes fields such as `bio`, `profile_picture`, `expertise`, `education`, `hobbies`, `cover_photo`, `phone` (with a `RegexValidator`), `date_of_birth`, `marital_status` (with choices), `gender` (with choices), `nationality`, and `national_id`. Additionally, it includes fields for emergency contact information. The model also provides calculated properties like `age` and `full_name` for convenience.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

All changes occurred on January 30, 2026. The `UserManager` was defined at 5:16:09 PM, immediately followed by the `User` model at 5:18:53 PM. A more extensive `Profile` model was added later the same day at 10:03:23 PM. This indicates a focused development session on establishing the user and profile infrastructure.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements:**

*   **Custom Django Authentication:** The project is customizing Django's built-in authentication by implementing a custom `UserManager` and `User` model based on `AbstractBaseUser`, allowing for email-based login and flexible user attributes.
*   **Timestamping:** All models (`User` and `Profile`) consistently include `DateTimeField` fields like `date_joined`/`created_at` (using `auto_now_add=True`) and `updated_at` (using `auto_now=True`) to automatically track creation and modification times, which is a common pattern for auditing and data management.
*   **Centralized User Management:** All changes are confined to the `c:\projects\tat\tale-craft-media.api\tale_craft\apps\users\` directory, indicating a dedicated effort to build a robust and detailed user and profile management system within a specific application module.
*   **Data Validation:** The `Profile` model demonstrates the use of `RegexValidator` for enforcing specific formats (e.g., phone numbers), highlighting attention to data quality.

## 2:57:07 AM
The log details significant development in a Django `users` application, primarily focusing on establishing a custom user model and an associated detailed user profile. All changes occurred on **1/30/2026**, indicating a focused development session.

### File-Specific Updates:

*   **`c:\projects\tat\tale-craft-media.api\tale_craft\apps\users\managers\user_manager.py` (Timestamp: 1/30/2026, 5:16:09 PM)**
    *   This file defines a `UserManager` class, inheriting from Django's `BaseUserManager`.
    *   It implements `create_user` and `create_superuser` methods.
    *   `create_user` ensures an email address is provided, normalizes it, sets the password, and saves the user.
    *   `create_superuser` enforces `is_staff=True`, `is_superuser=True`, and `is_active=True` by default, raising `ValueError` if these are not set, and then delegates to `create_user`. This sets up the core logic for managing custom user creation.

*   **`c:\projects\tat\tale-craft-media.api\tale_craft\apps\users\models\user.py` (Timestamp: 1/30/2026, 5:18:53 PM)**
    *   This file establishes a custom `User` model, extending `AbstractBaseUser` and `PermissionsMixin`.
    *   It defines `email` as a unique identifier (used as `USERNAME_FIELD`), `username` as another unique field, and includes `is_active`, `is_staff`, `date_joined`, and `updated_at` fields.
    *   The `objects` manager is explicitly set to the `UserManager` defined previously.
    *   `REQUIRED_FIELDS` is set to `['username']`.
    *   A `Meta` class specifies `db_table="users"` and adds database indexes for both `email` and `username` for performance. This provides the foundation for an email-based authentication system with a distinct username.

*   **`c:\projects\tat\tale-craft-media.api\tale_craft\apps\users\models\profile.py` (Timestamp: 1/30/2026, 10:03:23 PM)**
    *   This file introduces a comprehensive `Profile` model, designed to hold extensive user-specific information, linked to the `User` model via a `OneToOneField`.
    *   It includes fields for:
        *   **Basic profile:** `bio`, `profile_picture`, `expertise`, `education`, `hobbies`, `cover_photo`.
        *   **Personal information:** `phone` (with a `RegexValidator`), `date_of_birth`, `marital_status` (with predefined choices), `gender` (with predefined choices), `nationality`, and `national_id`.
        *   **Emergency contact:** `emergency_contact_name`, `emergency_relationship`, `emergency_phone` (also with `RegexValidator`), and `emergency_email`.
        *   **Timestamps:** `created_at` and `updated_at`.
    *   It also features `@property` methods to calculate `age` from `date_of_birth` and `full_name` by combining the user's first/last name or defaulting to username. This greatly expands the data stored per user beyond basic authentication details.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **User Management Focus:** All files belong to a `tale_craft\apps\users` directory, indicating a dedicated Django application for handling user authentication and profiles.
*   **Custom User Implementation:** The project uses Django's custom user model facilities (`AbstractBaseUser`, `PermissionsMixin`, and a custom `UserManager`) for flexible authentication, particularly for email-based logins.
*   **Timestamping:** Both the `User` and `Profile` models consistently use `auto_now_add=True` for creation timestamps (`date_joined`, `created_at`) and `auto_now=True` for update timestamps (`updated_at`), a standard practice for tracking object lifecycles.
*   **Separation of Concerns:** A clear pattern emerges with the separation of core authentication details (in the `User` model) from extended personal information (in the `Profile` model), linked via a `OneToOneField`. This is a common and recommended Django design pattern.
*   **Data Validation:** The `Profile` model specifically includes `RegexValidator` for phone number fields, demonstrating an emphasis on data quality.
*   **Date-Based Logic:** The `Profile` model includes property methods like `age` that perform calculations based on stored `date_of_birth`, showcasing application-specific logic within the model.
