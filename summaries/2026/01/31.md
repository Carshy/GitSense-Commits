# Activity Summary for 1/31/2026

## 1:57:05 AM
The provided log details the initial setup and customization of a user management system within a Django application, specifically focusing on the `tale_craft\apps\users` module.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\projects\tat\tale-craft-media.api\tale_craft\apps\users\managers\user_manager.py` (Timestamp: 1/30/2026, 5:16:09 PM):** This file introduces a custom `UserManager` class, inheriting from Django's `BaseUserManager`. It defines the core logic for creating both regular users (`create_user`) and superusers (`create_superuser`). Key aspects include email normalization, password hashing, and validation for superuser privileges (`is_staff`, `is_superuser`).

*   **`c:\projects\tat\tale-craft-media.api\tale_craft\apps\users\models\user.py` (Timestamp: 1/30/2026, 5:18:53 PM):** This file defines the custom `User` model for the application, inheriting from `AbstractBaseUser` and `PermissionsMixin`. It establishes `email` as the unique identifier and `USERNAME_FIELD`, with `username` as a `REQUIRED_FIELD`. Other fields include `is_active`, `is_staff`, `date_joined`, and `updated_at`. The model utilizes the `UserManager` defined previously and sets up database indexing for `email` and `username` for performance.

*   **`c:\projects\tat\tale-craft-media.api\tale_craft\apps\users\models\profile.py` (Timestamp: 1/30/2026, 10:03:23 PM):** This file introduces a comprehensive `Profile` model designed to store extensive personal information for each user. It features a `OneToOneField` link to the `User` model and includes fields such as `bio`, `profile_picture`, `expertise`, `education`, `hobbies`, `cover_photo`, `phone` (with a `RegexValidator`), `date_of_birth`, `marital_status` (with choices), `gender` (with choices), `nationality`, and `national_id`. Additionally, it includes fields for emergency contact information. The model also provides calculated properties like `age` and `full_name` for convenience.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

All changes occurred on January 30, 2026. The `UserManager` was defined at 5:16:09 PM, immediately followed by the `User` model at 5:18:53 PM. A more extensive `Profile` model was added later the same day at 10:03:23 PM. This indicates a focused development session on establishing the user and profile infrastructure.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements:**

*   **Custom Django Authentication:** The project is customizing Django's built-in authentication by implementing a custom `UserManager` and `User` model based on `AbstractBaseUser`, allowing for email-based login and flexible user attributes.
*   **Timestamping:** All models (`User` and `Profile`) consistently include `DateTimeField` fields like `date_joined`/`created_at` (using `auto_now_add=True`) and `updated_at` (using `auto_now=True`) to automatically track creation and modification times, which is a common pattern for auditing and data management.
*   **Centralized User Management:** All changes are confined to the `c:\projects\tat\tale-craft-media.api\tale_craft\apps\users\` directory, indicating a dedicated effort to build a robust and detailed user and profile management system within a specific application module.
*   **Data Validation:** The `Profile` model demonstrates the use of `RegexValidator` for enforcing specific formats (e.g., phone numbers), highlighting attention to data quality.
