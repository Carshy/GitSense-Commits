# Activity Summary for 1/29/2026

## 11:50:44 PM
The `c:\projects\tat\tale-craft-media.api\tale_craft\api\admin.py` file underwent a series of modifications, all occurring on January 29, 2026, between 7:31:02 PM and 7:35:27 PM.

The primary focus of these changes was the import paths for the `User` and `Profile` models, which are registered with the Django admin interface.

Initially, at 7:31:02 PM, both `User` and `Profile` were imported using a relative path: `from .models import User` and `from .models import Profile`.

A brief alteration occurred at 7:34:40 PM, where the import for `User` was changed to `from ..models import User`, suggesting an attempt to import from a parent directory's models. This change was almost immediately reverted at 7:34:57 PM, bringing the `User` import back to `from .models import User`.

The most significant and consistent pattern of change emerged from 7:35:20 PM onwards. First, the `User` model import was updated to `from users.models import User`. This was followed by a similar update for the `Profile` model at 7:35:27 PM, changing its import to `from users.models import Profile`.

Throughout all these changes, the core `UserAdmin` class definition, which customizes the Django admin's display, filters, search fields, and ordering for the `User` model, remained entirely consistent. This indicates that the structural aspects of the admin interface were stable, with only the source of the `User` and `Profile` models being actively refined.

In summary, the changes reflect an evolution in how the `User` and `Profile` models are referenced, transitioning from local or relative imports within the `api` app to explicit imports from a dedicated `users.models` module, likely due to a restructuring or refactoring of the application's model definitions into a separate `users` application.
