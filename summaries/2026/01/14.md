# Activity Summary for 1/14/2026

## 11:41:58 AM
The provided log details changes exclusively within the file `c:\projects\mini-patient-rdbms\rdbms\storage\Column.js`. This file defines a `Column` class responsible for handling individual column definitions in a storage layer, including data type validation (INTEGER, TEXT, BOOLEAN, DATE), constraint enforcement (PRIMARY KEY, UNIQUE, NOT NULL, AUTO_INCREMENT), and type coercion/conversion.

The core functional code of the `Column` class, including its constructor and methods like `validate`, `_convertType`, `_validateInteger`, `_validateText`, `_validateBoolean`, `_validateDate`, and `toString`, remains unchanged across all timestamps.

The significant changes observed are purely cosmetic, focusing on the removal of comments:

*   **1/14/2026, 11:38:21 AM:** The extensive file-level header comment, which described the purpose and functionalities of the `Column.js` file, was removed.
*   **1/14/2026, 11:39:06 AM:** The JSDoc comments for the `constructor` method were removed.
*   **1/14/2026, 11:41:35 AM:** The JSDoc comments for the `validate` method were removed.

The pattern across these changes is a progressive stripping of documentation (both high-level file descriptions and method-specific JSDoc) from the `Column.js` file, while the underlying logic and implementation of the column definition and validation class remain consistent.
