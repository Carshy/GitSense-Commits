# Activity Summary for 1/24/2026

## 6:05:22 AM
The file `c:\projects\tat\tale-craft-media.api\README.md` was updated on 1/24/2026, 5:21:26 AM. This README details a Django REST Framework (DRF) project template containerized with Docker. It outlines features like Django 3.x, PostgreSQL integration, Docker Compose setup for development and production, automatic migrations, and a structured project layout. The document provides comprehensive instructions for getting started, including cloning the repository, setting up environment variables from `.env.sample`, and building/running Docker containers. It also covers how to use the template by renaming project folders and apps, configuring Django settings, database, and Docker, and explains the development workflow and deployment considerations. The README mentions the project is under the MIT License and acknowledges inspirations.

The file `c:\projects\tat\tale-craft-media.api\LICENSE` was updated shortly after, on 1/24/2026, 5:23:21 AM. This file contains the full text of the MIT License, explicitly stating the copyright (c) 2023 Palwisha Akhtar. It grants broad permissions for the use, modification, distribution, and sale of the software, provided the copyright notice and permission notice are included, and disclaims all warranties.

A clear pattern across these changes is the establishment of a new Django DRF project template, indicated by the detailed setup instructions in the README and the immediate inclusion of the MIT License. Both files were updated within a very short timeframe on January 24, 2026, suggesting an initial project setup or a major update defining the project's scope, usage, and legal terms. The project is attributed to "Palwisha Akhtar" and focuses on a "Django (DRF) Dockerized Project Template."
