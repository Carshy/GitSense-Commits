# Activity Summary for 1/28/2026

## 11:14:04 AM
The `c:\projects\tat\tale-craft-media.api\tale_craft\config\settings\base.py` file underwent several updates:

*   **1/28/2026, 10:30:05 AM:** One of the two lines responsible for reading environment variables via `environ.Env.read_env` was commented out, specifically `environ.Env.read_env(BASE_DIR.__str__() + '/../.env')`, leaving `environ.Env.read_env(BASE_DIR.parent / ".env")` as the sole active method.
*   **1/28/2026, 10:53:48 AM:** The `INSTALLED_APPS` list was updated, replacing `'api.app1'` with `'api.users'`. This suggests a renaming or restructuring of an application within the project.
*   **1/28/2026, 11:00:20 AM:** The retrieval of `POSTGRES_PORT` from environment variables was modified from `env('POSTGRES_PORT')` to `env.int('POSTGRES_PORT')`, explicitly casting the port value to an integer.
*   **1/28/2026, 11:00:43 AM:** The `POSTGRES_PORT` retrieval was further enhanced by adding a default value, changing it to `env.int('POSTGRES_PORT', default=5432)`, ensuring a fallback if the environment variable is not set.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   All recorded changes occurred on January 28, 2026, indicating a concentrated development effort on this date.
*   The `base.py` file consistently uses the `django-environ` library to manage settings, pulling sensitive data like `SECRET_KEY` and PostgreSQL credentials (`POSTGRES_USER`, `POSTGRES_NAME`, `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, `POSTGRES_HOST`, `POSTGRES_PORT`) from environment variables.
*   The project setup includes standard Django components (`django.contrib.admin`, `django.contrib.auth`, etc.), `rest_framework`, and `django_filters`, suggesting a Django REST API application.
*   A detailed logging configuration is present, with handlers for console, file-based logs (`api.log`, `api_error.log`), and admin email alerts for errors.
