# Activity Summary for 1/15/2026

## 11:04:39 AM
The code changes primarily focus on the development and refinement of a mini-RDBMS project, spanning core engine functionalities, SQL parsing, and an interactive command-line interface.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\projects\mini-patient-rdbms\rdbms\engine\JoinEngine.js`**
    *   The file, timestamped from **1/14/2026, 2:26:45 PM** onwards, consistently implements `JoinEngine` functionalities including `innerJoin`, `leftJoin`, and `rightJoin`. It provides methods to merge rows with table prefixes and handles `NULL` values for unmatched rows in `LEFT JOIN`.
    *   A recurring pattern across multiple entries (e.g., **2:27:25 PM**, **2:28:01 PM**, **2:28:41 PM**, **2:29:31 PM**) involves the removal and occasional re-addition of JSDoc comments for its methods. There are no functional code changes within this series of updates; the logic for joins and row merging remains constant.

*   **`c:\projects\mini-patient-rdbms\rdbms\parser\SQLParser.js`**
    *   The initial state (around **1/14/2026, 2:33:16 PM**) introduced the `SQLParser` with methods for parsing `CREATE TABLE`, `DROP TABLE`, `INSERT`, `SELECT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, and `SHOW` commands, along with basic helper functions. Notably, the `_parseJoin` and `_parseShow` implementations were incomplete.
    *   A significant update at **1/14/2026, 2:33:40 PM** added the full `_parseJoin` logic, enabling the parsing of `INNER`, `LEFT`, and `RIGHT` join statements by delegating to the `JoinEngine`.
    *   The `_parseShow` method was completed around **1/14/2026, 2:34:45 PM**, adding support for `SHOW TABLES` and `SHOW COLUMNS FROM table_name`.
    *   Further enhancements around **1/14/2026, 2:36:17 PM** introduced `_parseValue` and `_parseValueList` helper methods to correctly interpret string, number, boolean, and `NULL` values in SQL queries.
    *   A crucial functional change at **1/14/2026, 3:16:27 PM** modified the regular expression for `_parseCreate` to accommodate multi-line column definitions in `CREATE TABLE` statements.
    *   Similar to `JoinEngine.js`, many entries (e.g., from **2:35:54 PM to 2:38:46 PM**) show minor textual changes, primarily around JSDoc comments or whitespace, rather than functional code alterations.

*   **`c:\projects\mini-patient-rdbms\rdbms\repl\REPL.js`**
    *   The file, first logged at **1/14/2026, 2:40:36 PM**, defines the interactive REPL, including methods to start the session, handle special commands (`.help`, `.exit`, `.tables`, `.stats`, `.clear`), display results, and show database statistics.
    *   Between **1/14/2026, 2:41:30 PM** and **1/14/2026, 2:52:36 PM**, there are numerous minor updates, mostly involving JSDoc comments and whitespace, without altering the core functionality of the REPL.

*   **`c:\projects\mini-patient-rdbms\rdbms\index.js`**
    *   Initially (at **1/14/2026, 2:53:56 PM**), this file exported RDBMS components grouped into categories like 'Main classes', 'Engines', 'Parser', and 'REPL'.
    *   By **1/14/2026, 2:54:10 PM**, the export structure was flattened, directly exporting all main RDBMS classes and modules (e.g., `Database`, `CRUDEngine`, `SQLParser`, `REPL`) without categorical nesting. Subsequent commits (up to **2:54:49 PM**) involved minor comment cleanups.

*   **`c:\projects\mini-patient-rdbms\demo.js`**
    *   The file, introduced at **1/14/2026, 2:56:41 PM**, provides a comprehensive demonstration of the RDBMS. It systematically creates patient, doctor, and appointment tables, inserts sample data, performs various `SELECT` queries (including joins), demonstrates `UPDATE` and `DELETE` operations, tests database constraints, runs advanced queries, and displays database statistics.
    *   Multiple entries between **1/14/2026, 2:58:16 PM** and **1/14/2026, 3:01:30 PM** show only minor formatting adjustments, such as removal of empty lines or comments, without any functional changes to the demo script.

*   **`c:\projects\mini-patient-rdbms\start-repl.js`**
    *   The initial version (**1/14/2026, 3:04:09 PM**) was a simple script to create an 'interactive' database and start the REPL.
    *   A significant functional update occurred on **1/15/2026, 5:22:10 AM**. This change transformed the `start-repl.js` into a script that pre-creates the patient management system tables (`patients`, `doctors`, `appointments`) upon startup, mirroring the schema from `demo.js`, and adds helpful tips for the user.

*   **`c:\projects\mini-patient-rdbms\package.json`**
    *   The file was initially created around **1/14/2026, 3:09:31 PM** with project metadata and script definitions (`repl`, `demo`, `start`).
    *   The `engines.node` constraint was briefly updated to `>=20.0.0` at **1/14/2026, 3:09:38 PM**, but quickly reverted to `>=14.0.0` at **1/14/2026, 3:09:52 PM**.

*   **`c:\projects\mini-patient-rdbms\README.md`**
    *   The `README.md` was created around **1/14/2026, 3:08:08 PM**, detailing the project's overview, structure, component breakdown, and usage instructions.
    *   Subsequent timestamps (up to **4:22:00 PM**) show no significant content changes, indicating minor saves or formatting updates.

*   **`c:\projects\mini-patient-rdbms\.gitignore`**
    *   The file, added at **1/14/2026, 4:26:52 PM**, correctly configures standard Git ignored files for a Node.js project (e.g., `node_modules`, `coverage`, build directories, debug logs). No changes observed in the subsequent timestamp.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **1/14/2026, 2:33:40 PM**: Completion of `_parseJoin` in `SQLParser.js`.
*   **1/14/2026, 2:34:45 PM**: Completion of `_parseShow` for `SHOW COLUMNS` in `SQLParser.js`.
*   **1/14/2026, 2:36:17 PM**: Addition of `_parseValue` and `_parseValueList` in `SQLParser.js` for robust value parsing.
*   **1/14/2026, 2:54:10 PM**: Simplification of export structure in `index.js`.
*   **1/14/2026, 2:56:41 PM**: Initial commit of the comprehensive `demo.js` patient management system.
*   **1/14/2026, 3:16:27 PM**: Functional update to `_parseCreate` regex in `SQLParser.js` to support multi-line `CREATE TABLE` definitions.
*   **1/15/2026, 5:22:10 AM**: `start-repl.js` was updated to pre-populate the database with the patient management schema, making the REPL more immediately usable for demonstrations.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Modular Architecture**: The project is consistently structured into logical layers (`storage`, `engine`, `parser`, `repl`), reflecting a clear design for a relational database.
*   **SQL-like Language Implementation**: A primary focus is on parsing and executing SQL commands (CRUD, JOINs, SHOW) through custom engines.
*   **Interactive Development**: The frequent, minor changes to JSDoc comments and whitespace suggest an active development process with iterative refinement and formatting.
*   **Demonstration and Usability**: The `demo.js` and the later update to `start-repl.js` highlight an emphasis on showcasing the RDBMS's capabilities and providing a user-friendly setup for interaction.
*   **Constraint Enforcement**: The `demo.js` explicitly tests unique and not-null constraints, indicating that validation is a core aspect of the RDBMS implementation.
*   **Regular Expressions for Parsing**: The `SQLParser.js` heavily relies on regular expressions to break down and interpret SQL statements.
